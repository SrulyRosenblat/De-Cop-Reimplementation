      "Recent instruction fine-tuned models can solve multiple NLP tasks when prompted to do so, with machine translation (MT) being a prominent use case. However, current research often focuses on standard performance benchmarks, leaving compelling fairness and ethical considerations behind. In MT, this might lead to misgendered translations, resulting, among other harms, in the perpetuation of stereotypes and prejudices. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether and to what extent such models exhibit gender bias in machine translation and how we can mitigate it.\n",

      "Concretely, we compute established gender bias metrics on the WinoMT corpus from English to German and Spanish. We discover that IFT models default to male-inflected translations, even disregarding female occupational stereotypes. Next, using interpretability methods, we unveil that models systematically overlook the pronoun indicating the gender of a target occupation in misgendered translations. Finally, based on this finding, we propose an easy-to-implement and effective bias mitigation solution based on few shot learning that leads to significantly fairer translations.\n",

      "Instruction fine-tuned (IFT) models, such as FlanT5 (Chung et al., 2022) and mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2023a), are trained on large corpora of machine learning tasks verbalized in natural language and learned through standard language modeling. The large and diverse mixture of training tasks has led to unmatched transfer performance – if prompted properly, models are able to virtually solve any standard NLP task, including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, question answering, and more (Sanh et al., 2022).\n",

      "However, most efforts on their evaluation have focused on standard benchmarks only, with a prominent focus on testing zero-shot abilities (Chung et al., 2022) and cross-lingual generalization (Muennighoff et al., 2023b), and have thus largely ignored the models’ social impact (Hovy and Spruit, 2016). This lacuna is extremely surprising as (a) IFT models are based on pretrained language models, which are widely known to encode societal biases and unfair stereotypes (Nadeem et al., 2021; Nozza et al., 2021, inter alia); and (b) exposing models to many fine-tuning sources can exacerbate biased behaviors as stereotypical demonstrations add up (Srivastava et al., 2022).\n",

Still, few efforts have been spent on bias evaluation and mitigation for these models so far (a notable exception being provided by Akyürek et al. (2022)), putting their societal beneficial use at risk. In this work, we address this research gap by studying occupational gender bias in zero- and few-shot setups in one of the, arguably, most prominent NLP applications to date, machine translation (MT).\n",

      "Based on attribution interpretability, we find that models systematically ignore the pronoun (and thus, the conveyed gender information) when producing misgendered translations. In contrast, correctly translated professions relate to higher contributions of the pronoun in the choices taken. (3) Based on our insights, we propose a novel and easy-to-use bias mitigation method – informed by interpretability scores! The differences in the attribution scores lead us to hypothesize that models that are used in a fewshot setup would benefit from provided translations mostly, if exactly in those examples they would normally overlook the pronoun.\n",

(2017) as well as excellent guides such as “The Annotated Transformer.”2 In this work, we denote the number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H, and the number of self-attention heads as A. 3 We primarily report results on two model sizes: BERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024, A=16, Total Parameters=340M).\n",

We refer to this procedure as a “masked LM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we only predict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input.\n",

      "The learning rate is a very important hyperparameter of TTA. Choi et al. (2022) shows that a large learning rate may cause the model to collapse, while a small learning rate can make TTA almost ineffective. However, careful hyper-parameter selection for TTA during test time is not feasible in practice. Therefore, an advanced TTA approach should be less sensitive to the learning rate. We use the XLM-RoBERTa-base as the source model to test the sensitivity of each TTA method to the learning rate on the XQuAD dataset.\n",

With the increase in the learning rate, the performance of them drops rapidly after reaching the maximum, which indicates that they are prone to model collapse under a large learning rate. OIL performs better than Tent, EATA and SAR, but it still rapidly deteriorates after maintaining performance for a while. In contrast, Anti-CF is less sensitive to the learning rate. As the learning rate increases, the performance of Anti-CF will slowly decline until it approaches the performance of the source model.\n",

However, even a slight increase in α, such as 0.1, provides enough constraint to prevent the model from collapsing, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the EM score from 1.42% to 42.69%.

We discover that the efficient side block of Anti-CF can potentially solve this problem by reducing the memory required for back propagation.

However, performance in other languages and cultures initially increases then decreases. This reveals a trade-off: while a substantial proportion of English data aids the model’s task comprehension, an appropriate amount of augmented data from other cultures facilitates the model’s transfer ability. A ratio of roughly 3:1 yields optimal results. We further investigate this by holding the scale constant and incrementally increasing the English and augmented datasets.\n",

Overall, this formulation is similar to the approach of Peters et al. (2017), with the exception that we share some weights between directions instead of using completely independent parameters. \n",

We simply run the biLM and record all of the layer representations for each word. Then, we let the end task model learn a linear combination of these representations, as described below.

As the results are shown in Table 6, we can see that the performance of every single student improves with an extension to four students in the DisCo cohort, which demonstrates that the generalization ability of students is enhanced when they learn together with increasing numbers of peers. Besides, the results in Table 6 have validated the necessity of co-training with multiple students.

A novel E-TSDM is further proposed to mitigate the corresponding singularities in a timestep-sharing manner. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both performance and adaptability to the baselines, including unconditional generation, conditional generation, and fast sampling.

Recently, it has become increasingly common to pre-train the entire model on a data-rich task.

In applications of transfer learning to computer vision (Oquab et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2014; Huh et al., 2016; Yosinski et al., 2014), pre-training is typically done via supervised learning on a large labeled data set like ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2009). \n",

Self-attention is a variant of attention (Graves, 2013; Bahdanau et al., 2015) that processes a sequence by replacing each element by a weighted average of the rest of the sequence. The original Transformer consisted of an encoder-decoder architecture and was intended for sequence-to-sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) tasks. It has recently also become common to use models consisting of a single Transformer layer stack, with varying forms of self-attention used to produce architectures appropriate for language modeling (Radford et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2019) or classification and span prediction tasks (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). \n",

First, an input sequence of tokens is mapped to a sequence of embeddings, which is then passed into the encoder. The encoder consists of a stack of “blocks”, each of which comprises two subcomponents: a self-attention layer followed by a small feed-forward network. Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) is applied to the input of each subcomponent. \n",

Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is applied within the feed-forward network, on the skip connection, on the attention weights, and at the input and output of the entire stack.

The output of the final decoder block is fed into a dense layer with a softmax output, whose weights are shared with the input embedding matrix. All attention mechanisms in the Transformer are split up into independent “heads” whose outputs are concatenated before being further processed. Since self-attention is order-independent (i.e. it is an operation on sets), it is common to provide an explicit position signal to the Transformer. \n",

      "While the original Transformer used a sinusoidal position signal or learned position embeddings, it has recently become more common to use relative position embeddings (Shaw et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018a). Instead of using a fixed embedding for each position, relative position embeddings produce a different learned embedding according to the offset between the “key” and “query” being compared in the self-attention mechanism. We use a simplified form of position embeddings where each “embedding” is simply a scalar that is added to the corresponding logit used for computing the attention weights. For efficiency, we also share the position embedding parameters across all layers in our model, though within a given layer each attention head uses a different learned position embedding. \n",

In this work, we use 32 embeddings for all of our models with ranges that increase in size logarithmically up to an offset of 128 beyond which we assign all relative positions to the same embedding. Note that a given layer is insensitive to relative position beyond 128 tokens, but subsequent layers can build a sensitivity to larger offsets by combining local information from previous layers. To summarize, our model is roughly equivalent to the original Transformer proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) with the exception of removing the Layer Norm bias, placing the layer normalization outside the residual path, and using a different position embedding scheme. \n",

Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model.\n",

      "Consistency models (Song et al., 2023) are an emerging family of generative models that produce high-quality samples using a single network evaluation. Unlike GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), consistency models are not trained with adversarial optimization and thus sidestep the associated training difficulty. Compared to score-based diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021), consistency models do not require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality samples. They are trained to generate samples in a single step, but still retain important advantages of diffusion models, such as the flexibility to exchange compute for sample quality through multistep sampling, and the ability to perform zero-shot data editing.\n",

      " We can train consistency models using either consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). The former requires pre-training a diffusion model and distilling the knowledge therein into a consistency model. The latter allows us to train consistency models directly from data, establishing them as an independent family of generative models. Previous work (Song et al., 2023) demonstrates that CD significantly outperforms CT. However, CD adds computational overhead to the training process since it requires learning a separate diffusion model. Additionally, distillation limits the sample quality of the consistency model to that of the diffusion model.\n",

Secondly, learned metrics require pre-training auxiliary networks for feature extraction. Training with these metrics requires backpropagating through extra neural networks, which increases the demand for compute. To tackle these challenges, we introduce improved techniques for CT that not only surpass CD in sample quality but also eliminate the dependence on learned metrics like LPIPS.

As illustrated in Fig. 4a, this lognormal distribution assigns significantly less weight to high noise levels. Moreover, it also moderates the emphasis on smaller noise levels.

This trend suggests that after a few iterations, the candidate data becomes increasingly feature-biased and less suitable for the domain transfer. In the Review domain, the best performance of Vanilla self-training is achieved using with GRsConf-selected pseudo-data.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors [MCCD13, PSM14] and fed to task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations [DL15, MBXS17, PNZtY18] (though still applied to task-specific architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP+17] have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-specific architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\n",

However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task.\n",

There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many of these tasks it is difficult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task.

There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it [YdC+19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\n",

Recent work [RWC+19] attempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\n",

Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of solving language tasks. Another recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer language models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [RNSS18], to 300 million parameters [DCLT18], to 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19], and finally 17 billion parameters [Tur20].\n",

For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we allow as many demonstrations as will fit into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”, where we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only an instruction in natural language is given to the model.\n",

PMF (Hu et al., 2022), FLUTE (Triantafillou et al., 2021) and FT (Dhillon et al., 2020) focus on adapting existing parameters without inserting new ones. To manage the adaptation/overfitting tradeoff in the few-shot regime, PMF fine-tunes the whole ResNet or ViT backbone, but with carefully managed learning rates. Meanwhile, FLUTE hand-picks a set of FILM parameters with a modified ResNet backbone for few-shot fine-tuning, while keeping the majority of the feature extractor frozen.\n",

Meanwhile, we expect large N to suffer overfitting due to ultimately selecting a large number of parameters (N networks, times the number of learnable parameters each) based on a small support set, defeating the purpose of our whole selective fine-tuning paradigm. To illustrate this we conduct a small experiment on a subset of 30 episodes in Table 7 (right), comparing the support/train and query/test accuracy as a function of N.

Unlike the traditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al., 2003) which consists of many small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and train a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation. Most of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoder– decoders (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each language, or involve a language-specific encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then compared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014).\n",

A potential issue with this encoder–decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a fixed-length vector.

Taking inspirations from recent progresses in non-autoregressive text generation (Libovicky and Helcl, 2018; Saharia et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022b), in this work, we propose a novel method for text editing that meets the aforementioned expectations by making a direct yet effective extension to connectionist temporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006). \n",

For image encoding, we utilize CLIP encoder (Radford et al., 2021) to capture the global information of a picture and then use MLP functions to transform it into the same embedding space as the word.

On the WMT’14 English to French translation task, we obtained a BLEU score of 34.81 by directly extracting translations from an ensemble of 5 deep LSTMs (with 384M parameters and 8,000 dimensional state each) using a simple left-to-right beam search decoder. This is by far the best result achieved by direct translation with large neural networks. For comparison, the BLEU score of an SMT baseline on this dataset is 33.30 [29]. The 34.81 BLEU score was achieved by an LSTM with a vocabulary of 80k words, so the score was penalized whenever the reference translation contained a word not covered by these 80k.\n",

As a result, SGD could learn LSTMs that had no trouble with long sentences. The simple trick of reversing the words in the source sentence is one of the key technical contributions of this work.

However, it is not clear how to apply an RNN to problems whose input and the output sequences have different lengths with complicated and non-monotonic relationships. The simplest strategy for general sequence learning is to map the input sequence to a fixed-sized vector using one RNN, and then to map the vector to the target sequence with another RNN (this approach has also been taken by Cho et al.

However, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [16] is known to learn problems with long range temporal dependencies, so an LSTM may succeed in this setting Our actual models differ from the above description in three important ways. First, we used two different LSTMs: one for the input sequence and another for the output sequence, because doing so increases the number model parameters at negligible computational cost and makes it natural to train the LSTM on multiple language pairs simultaneously [18].\n",

So for example, instead of mapping the sentence a, b, c to the sentence α, β, γ, the LSTM is asked to map c, b, a to α, β, γ, where α, β, γ is the translation of a, b, c. This way, a is in close proximity to α, b is fairly close to β, and so on, a fact that makes it easy for SGD to “establish communication” between the input and the output.

More broadly, in generic sequence modeling, how to capture long-term dependency has been a long-standing research problem. From this perspective, since the ubiquitous adaption of LSTM, many efforts have been spent on relieving the vanishing gradient problem, including better initialization (Le et al., 2015), additional loss signal (Trinh et al., 2018), augmented memory structure (Ke et al., 2018) and others that modify the internal architecture of RNNs to ease the optimization (Wu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018).\n",

Specifically, a trainable neural network is used to encode the context x<t into a fixed size hidden state, which is multiplied with the word embeddings to obtain the logits. The logits are then fed into the Softmax function, yielding a categorical probability distribution over the next token. In order to apply Transformer or self-attention to language modeling, the central problem is how to train a Transformer to effectively encode an arbitrarily long context into a fixed size representation.

Under this training paradigm, information never flows across segments in either the forward or backward pass. There are two critical limitations of using a fixed length context.

As shown in Fig. 1b, this procedure ensures that each prediction utilizes the longest possible context exposed during training, and also relieves context fragmentation issue encountered in training.

Besides achieving extra long context and resolving fragmentation, another benefit that comes with the recurrence scheme is significantly faster evaluation. Specifically, during evaluation, the representations from the previous segments can be reused instead of being computed from scratch as in the case of the vanilla model.

ECL is the longest length to which increasing the context span would lead to a gain more than a threshold.

Rather than fine-tuning all layers at once, which risks catastrophic forgetting, we propose to gradually unfreeze the model starting from the last layer as this contains the least general knowledge (Yosinski et al., 2014): We first unfreeze the last layer and fine-tune all unfrozen layers for one epoch.\n",

In this task, we provide a sentence containing scrambled words to LLMs and then ask them to recover the original sentence from it.  This task can be utilized to directly measure the capability of LLMs to recognize and reconstruct the scrambled words in a sentence.  (2) Scrambled Question Answering (ScrQA).

To address this problem, we analyze the relation between the confidence of ˆy(i) and the precision of z(i). In Figure 4, we observe that highconfidence predictions (i.e., ˆy(i) predicted with a high probability) are associated with more accurate grammaticality labels. Therefore, we propose to select a highly confident subset Dsub from D′m such that for every x(i) ∈ Dsub, the fixer predicts ˆy(i) with probability greater than 0.9. \n",

Xie et al. (2020) has demonstrated the importance of introducing noise throughout the self-training process. Accordingly, we propose a masking-based data augmentation approach when building the critic. Specifically, for each sentence x(i) ∈ Dsub, we generate an augmented sentence x(i) masked by randomly replacing p% tokens with the [MASK] token, and minimize the loss function Lmasked with respect to the critic’s model parameters: Another issue of selecting high-confidence pseudo-labels is data scarcity.

To circumvent this problem, we began with training the configuration A (Table 1), shallow enough to be trained with random initialisation.

In this section, we present the image classification results achieved by the described ConvNet architectures on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset (which was used for ILSVRC 2012–2014 challenges). The dataset includes images of 1000 classes, and is split into three sets: training (1.3M images), validation (50K images), and testing (100K images with held-out class labels).

After the GPU batch gradients are computed, they are averaged to obtain the gradient of the full batch. Gradient computation is synchronous across the GPUs, so the result is exactly the same as when training on a single GPU. While more sophisticated methods of speeding up ConvNet training have been recently proposed (Krizhevsky, 2014), which employ model and data parallelism for different layers of the net, we have found that our conceptually much simpler scheme already provides a speedup of 3.75 times on an off-the-shelf 4-GPU system, as compared to using a single GPU.\n",

The error rate of our architecture saturates when the depth reaches 19 layers, but even deeper models might be beneficial for larger datasets. We also compared the net B with a shallow net with five 5 × 5 conv. layers, which was derived from B by replacing each pair of 3 × 3 conv. layers with a single 5 × 5 conv. layer (which has the same receptive field as explained in Sect. 2.3).

Firstly, instead of using a fixed forward or backward factorization order as in conventional AR models, XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence w.r.t. all possible permutations of the factorization order.

The idea of permutation-based AR modeling has been explored in [32, 12], but there are several key differences.

Specifically, for a sequence x of length T, there are T! different orders to perform a valid autoregressive factorization.

      "These complex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because each individual component must be trained separately. We reframe object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only look once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are present and where they are. YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance.\n",

      "This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection. First, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection as a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline. We simply run our neural network on a new image at test time to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45 frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan X GPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This means we can process streaming video in real-time with less than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO achieves more than twice the mean average precision of other real-time systems.\n",

      "Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN. Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects.\n",
