Another is the amount of parallelism that can be achieved, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations needed.
	[3] In this section, we will compare and contrast self-attention layers with other commonly used layers, such as recurrent and convolutional layers, which are used to transform one variable-length sequence of symbolic representations into another sequence of the same length. This is a common architecture in neural networks, often used in sequence transduction models like encoders and decoders. To justify the use of self-attention, we will consider three key criteria: the computational cost per layer, the amount of computation that can be parallelized, and the minimum number of sequential operations required.
	[4] In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi , zi ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata. One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
