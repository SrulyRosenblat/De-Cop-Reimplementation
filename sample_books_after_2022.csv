A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Wulf said, Was I really the only one who lived? It appears so. The rest were burned, drowned or frozen. I sent divers and ships to look. He closed his eyes. The Plague of fandauth is spreading, Einlek said. The Nameless One brought a sickness from the Womb of Fire, a plague that beset the people of Yikala. It must have returned. Whatever attacked our king, we can be sure it serves our enemy.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I cling to faith as flame clings to a wick already curled and black. The Mother will see us through this, Esbar. The Priory, perhaps. What of you and I? Tunuva had never thought she would feel truly cold again, until Esbar uqNra asked her that question. That decision must be yours. Her throat constricted as she spoke. Nothing has changed for me. Esbar sank deeper into the chair.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"After four years of Hran rule, the city still appeared Lacustrine, though the tents beyond its wall served as a strong reminder of the conquest. Furtia and Nayimathun landed near the High Perch. The stronghold bestrode a crag to the west, its sloping walls made tall and smooth. Oxen and horses, eagles and dragons pranced across its roofs, and a sun and moon gleamed on the doors, to be parted down the middle when they opened.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"In exchange for his blade, the knight of Inysca had two conditions. First, he would see the people of Lasia convert to his new religion of Six Virtues. And second, when he returned to his own country, he would have Cleolind as his bride. Siyu stopped to clear her throat. Tunuva passed her a goblet of walnut milk, which she drank. And what then?",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Glorian entered to find only three of the Dukes Spiritual waiting for her. Your Grace, Lady Brangain said quietly. They all dipped their heads. Forgive us for disturbing you at this hour. We thought it right that you heard as soon as possible. Where is the Lord Protector? Glorian asked her. He rode out with Lord Damud and Lady Gladwin before dawn. They are on their way to instruct the earls and barons of the northern provinces, so they can muster your people to defend our queendom.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"They have simply chosen to conserve their strength. Why did their strength wane? If a godsinger does not know the answer to that question, surely no one living does. An old boardwalk led into the lake, to the small island at its heart. The gods are benign, Emperor Jorodu said as they crossed, but they are not of our world. They prefer not to involve themselves in the politics and conflicts of humankind.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"In the event of his death, the heir to Inys may wed another relative of Queen Rozaria of Yscalin  in the first or second degree, specifically  within the next month. Usually the clause is included because one of the parties has some illness, or partakes in dangerous pursuits, Lade Edith said. A sensible precaution. Prince Therico had a fragile constitution. Lord Randroth set the document in question on the table.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"She did not have to stand here and try to outwit the River Lord. She did not have to become like him  and she had come so close, some days. This court had made her reckless, untrusting and hard; it had almost made her cruel. Now she remembered the godsinger of Mount Ipyeda, who had wished for nothing more than the life she already had.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Another silver Noziken. Dumai looked at them all, the whole belfry of courtiers. Her father had summoned her because she owed allegiance to no one. Now she saw that no one owed allegiance to her, either. I am alone. She stood at a great distance from herself. I am alone, with my foot in the fishnet. No, not alone. Outside, a dragon waited for her.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Her first wild thought was that the gallery must have been walled up. Then the hanging was drawn back, and a stricken face appeared, cast into shadow. Who in Halgalant are you? Glorian demanded. Pain and embarrassment sharpened her voice. She had not thought to see anyone up here. The man  a young man, not much older than her  stared back at her in shock.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Gladwin Fynch (Lady Gladwin): Duchess of Temperance, descendant of the Knight of Temperance. Guma Vetalda (the Hermit of Hart Grove): High Prince of Yscalin and Duke of Kvuga, and twin brother of Rozaria III of Yscalin, born a few minutes after her. Uncle to the Donmato Alarico and granduncle to Princess Idrega and Prince Therico. He rules from the stronghold of Hart Grove and is the wealthiest man in Yscalin, thanks to the mines known collectively as the Ufarassus.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I never understood what that meant before now. What if she used the same magic as Canthe? Esbar looked at it, her expression resolving. Hold the gate, she ordered their sisters. I need higher ground. Tunuva ran towards the cliffs with her. Royal tombs were carved into their western face. In their wake, the gates cracked open to let out a flood of Ersyri soldiers, roaring as they made a last foray.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Wulf grabbed whatever he could throw: weapons, two oars, a rack that must once have held meat, a table with a broken leg. With so many hands working together, the pile was soon high enough to give the creatures trouble breaking through. Fire archers came to set it ablaze. Its coming, a voice cried. The wyvern was back, and it had them all caught like fish in a net.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I have left a warning for our sisters in the archives, telling them to be wary of strangers. What of the Inysh matter? Tunuva asked. Will you leave word of that in the archives, too? Yes. Her gaze turned distant. I will leave a tablet there, stating that the Queen of Inys is always to have a mage as her protector; that this is my ruling as Prioress of the Orange Tree  but I will allow our future sisters to interpret my reasons as they see fit.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I mean to keep an eye on her. Yes, Im sure you would be happy to keep a close watch on a beautiful woman. Kanifa cocked a heavy eyebrow, a faint smile on his lips. Go to your mother, Dumai of Ipyeda. He continued down the corridor. She will cleanse you of such earthly thoughts. Dumai screened her grin behind her hair as she stepped into the room.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Together, they proclaimed that the Lord Protector was in residence. The wind blew hard. Wulf coughed into a gloved hand. Inys might not be half as icy as Hrth in late winter, but their hideaway was damp and cold, and they dared not risk a fire. As the sun rose, Mara returned from her scouting, coming on foot from the hills. Wulf stared when he saw who was with her.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Then another face, pale and terrified. The memories were far away, so far they no longer held a clear shape, and ran like water. But he knew he had been to this part of the wood before. How had he escaped, the first time? He was laughing and the sun was bright, and he tasted honey like a prayer on his lips. Who are you?",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Unora smiled. Dumai would have liked that very much, I think. The Grand Empress glanced up at the dragon, who returned the look, blowing fog through her nostrils. You should be patient, Lady Nikeya, the Grand Empress said, the corners of her mouth tweaking. My granddaughter may yet guide you herself. The dead whisper through the crash of the waves. Sometimes, they may even choose to return to us  we, who are left on the shore.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"She told me I disgraced you both. Esbar loves you with her soul, as we all do. She loves the Mother more. As we all must  but Siyu, I was there when Esbar gave birth to you. You have made her so proud over the years. This mistake is a small part of your life. It does not define it. Swallowing, Siyu managed a nod.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"As the wound smoked, he watched the glow leave its eye, an ember turning cold in its socket. His own eye had puffed shut. What had struck him, he had no idea. He had lost count of the talons scraping at his mail, the beaks striking his helm. He planted the end of his long axe in the sand. Wheezing from the smoke, he scraped his hair from his eyes and peered towards Bithandun, so tired he was almost drunk with it, swaying.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Tunuva wished Narha could comfort her, too  that her forebear could lean down from that column and brush away her nightmares. In the last one, Esbar had stabbed her in the heart, and she had woken in a sweat, convinced it was blood. She had not told Esbar. Across the hall, Esbar was taking her time at the rack. When she nodded to an Ersyri sword, the armourer removed its silver-mounted scabbard, wiped its blade with an oiled cloth, and handed it to her.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"His need for power has grown in this chaos. This fire will have convinced him that Clan Kuposa must seize its chance to rule, while the gods are at their weakest. I can imagine him performing a noble sacrifice of the Noziken. Epabo, Dumai said, thank you, for everything. I will lead the gods to avert his folly. She marched from the tent, into the freezing night, to collect what she would need.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I have sat here in the canyon for a week, to warn those who would come too close. I cant go back. I would sooner starve than He made the sign of the sword, his hand trembling. No soul should enter Halgalant that way. These people look to you for guidance, Saintsman, Regny sneered. And you cower down here? I am a sanctarian, not a warrior or a physician.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"The sun has risen. Her voice was bereft of hope. The wyverns can see the moor clearly now. I dont think it will be long before our soldiers are dead. Even with the ones who came from Paupers Henge? Its not enough, Glorian. Theyre so tired. Tears streaked her cheeks. I feel just as I did when you fell off your horse. Youre in danger again, and I cant save you.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Glorian drew herself up. Mother retires after eventide. I will need to be at the spyhole by then. She grimaced. Lets not tell Jules. Shell only worry. They looked at one another. Or Adela, they agreed in unison. **** After the evening meal, she and Helisent changed and walked to the Royal Sanctuary. Sir Bramel and Dame Erda closed the doors behind them, leaving Glorian to her supposed reflection.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Every head on the ship turned. Bardholt placed a hand on the side. Archers, he called. Along with half the seafarers, Regny nocked an arrow. Steady. Sire, what comes? a voice said. Let us see. Bardholt narrowed his eyes. It has been a long time since I last heard drums. Not drums, Wulf thought at first, but Bardholt would know better. After all, he had been to war.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"By the light of the low-burning fires, they shared tales of their deeds, raising their cups to those who had ascended to Halgalant. Hunger was the unwelcome guest. Where food had once been rich, now there was only simple fare, even for the king and his guard. You all fought like the Saint himself today, Einlek said, when they had scraped every plate. None more than Gthur Wyrmkiller, whose harpoon felled the beast.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"What makes you think I would have you, Lady Sabran? Her name was a dark thrum in his throat. How do you know I dont already have a consort in my own kingdom? Because I saw how you looked at me in the throne room. (He had not said no.) And how often. King Bardholt offered no reply. Sabran stood tall before him, for she was not her mother.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Unora took a layer of cloth from the middle of the table, revealing the oily blue stone. Empress Mokwo wrote of a stone that could command the waters and the winds. Even the gods heeded its call, she said. It was said to resemble a moon, so the Grand Empress did expect it to be pale. Dumai watched her face. It had been a long time since she had seen her mother look nervous.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"With surprising care, she drew a thread of damp hair between her fingers, teasing out a pine needle. Are you certain you dont want me to comb this, Princess? Dumai could feel her own breath betraying her. A warm drift in her darkest waters. Daughter, have you lost your senses? I will manage, she said, starting to draw away. Wait. You said I couldnt style it for this court.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Dumai stared at the writing. Tonra speaks of a comet that will come in the twelfth year of the fifth century  next year  to cool the risen fire. This must be the answer. A comet. His expression changed. A comet is what keeps the balance in check. Father might know of it  but if this is true, this time of fire will not last for ever, just as Master Kiprun said.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"And she understood what the dragon wanted. With a hundred thousand eyes on her, she reached out with trembling fingers. A living dragon, slippery as a fish, real and alive beneath her palm. There was kinship in that touch, and strength. Furtia nudged back with her snout. Come. She made a sound like distant thunder, and Dumai took another step. She closed her eyes, feeling a pull, a likeness, a want.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Furtia and I will get her away. Taugran is much stronger than Furtia, Nikeya protested. You know this, Dumai. Not for long. I feel the coming of the star. It was true. Her awareness of it was taut and strong, a string pulled along the neck of a lute, tuned to something that moved closer by the hour. Nikeya, Unora said quietly, touching her shoulder, will you leave us a moment, and watch over Epabo?",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Dumai was frozen stiff. She could smell the beast, its wrongness, and the closer it came, the harder her heart pounded. Its eyes were fixed on her. Great one, stop! Her heels slipped as more briny water bubbled up beneath her. Furtia Stop, its too strong! Furtia opened her jaws in a roar. Then a wave of hot air struck her, and so did a terrible iron horn, scraping along her side.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I had to count the zeros several times before I could believe it. You did it, my mother said. She tried to smile, but we both wound up crying instead. As we celebrated, I wasnt thinking about how lonely I might feel, or how much I would miss my family. I couldnt comprehend what it would mean to attain that first foothold in a world they would be unable to follow me into.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"A country that first abandons and then condemns people without money who have the temerity to get sick, accusing them of causing their own deaths. It is still hard for me not to think of my fathers death as a kind of negligent homicide, facilitated and sped by the states failure to fulfill its most basic responsibilities to him and others like him. With our broken safety net, our strained systems of care and support, the deep and corrosive inequalities we have yet to address, its no wonder that so many of us find ourselves alone, struggling to get the help we need when we or our loved ones are suffering.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"But had I been wrong to feel that way? They certainly never saw their burdens as mine to share, instead choosing to shield me from them for as long as they could. They were my parents: they looked after me, not the other way around. * * * The lack of air-conditioning in my childhood home was bearable because we could open our windows at nightexcept during wildfire season, when we might occasionally suffer and sweat in the hot, tightly sealed rooms of our house.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When I was at my most anxious, fretting about one or both of my kids, Mom would always tell me to relax, take a deep breath, stop worrying. The girls are going to be okay. It was no empty, unthinking reassurance she offered; she believed it, every time. I couldnt understand her certainty, and sometimes, I admit, resented itshe was a parent, too, and as anxious as I was.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When I lived here, I used to walk to another field near our old house to watch the sky darken above gold-limned hills. Sometimes, driving home in the evening, Id pull over to admire the viewthe riotous colors of sunset, the slow-deepening blue of the mountains as the light receded. Ive relaxed at peaceful eastern lakes and walked along Atlantic beaches, but have yet to find any substitute for these mountains.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When a friend asked if I minded that my parents were selling the home Id grown up in, I scoffed. The last person to live in my childhood bedroom hadnt even been me, but a friend of minemy parents, with typical openhandedness, had let her stay with them rent-free for a year and a half after her own parents kicked her out. There were things about the house Id been fond of: the sprawling, shady backyard that had once contained my rickety old swing set; my room with its blue walls and bursting bookshelves and my cats favorite scratching post; the minuscule spare bedroom that I was eventually permitted to turn into a writing space, nearly every square inch filled with our lumpy blue futon and the giant desk I had begged my mother to buy at a yard sale.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"The medication hed been prescribed was expensive without insurance and also upset his stomach, so he stopped taking it, saying that he couldnt work and serve food all day while feeling nauseated. As restaurant manager, he was usually the last one who got to take a break or eat lunch, and when he did get a meal, the food most readily available were the pizzas he helped make.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"If you really knew and didnt tell us, that was a real dick move, Dad. He did look peaceful, as if he had welcomed death, or at least been ready for it. When we approached to say our final goodbyes, Mom, mostly cried out by then, put her arm around my shoulders, her solid warmth a familiar comfort as always. Dont despair, she told me.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Though Ive often wished that we could have come up with an argument that would have changed his mind, my mother believed nothing either of us could say would have swayed him. She said that he remembered his mothers agony after organ rejection, and in the end he believed that neither dialysis nor a transplant would give him a long life. The dialysis did its job, as it had for his mother, first saving and then extending his life.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Four months after my mother died, a fire started fifteen minutes from her neighborhood. High winds carried the sparks far afield, allowing the blaze to grow and fan out for miles. Unlike the wildfires I remember from childhood, this one roared parallel to some of the busiest roads in the area, ravaging parkland, businesses, and thousands of homes. I was shocked to see news of the runaway destruction, although California wildfires had been in the news for weeks, and Id heard about the terrible air quality in the Bay Area, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I cry while I eat or drink. I cry in the shower, and when I lie down to try to sleep. Even when I am worn out, too hoarse for my sobs to make much of a sound, the tears keep coming, silently drifting down my cheeks. All I can think about is how, at the end, I wasnt with her. She was the kind of mother who deserved to have her child there when she died.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Thats what she meant when she told me, as a child, that I could never disappoint her. Thats why she and my father always said it didnt matter where I went, what I did with my life, what I accomplishedthey would always be proud of me. Thats why she believes that there is nothing for her to forgive now. I can choose to accept her at her word or not, keep chastising myself or not, but the truth is that this is what she has long believed: I am her daughter, so I am enough.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"All I would have focused on was that our expected family contribution was zero. Although many people identify as middle-of-the-road, middle-class, average Americans, there are differences between a working-class and a middle-class existence, and these differences can be far from subtle. If you grow up as I did and happen to be very fortunate, as I was, your family might sacrifice much so that you can go to college.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"In photos from that visit, I am a chubby, happy one-year-old in a flowered blouse and a blue corduroy jumper, no longer small for my age, boasting a toothy grin, chipmunk cheeks, and black hair that sticks straight up in defiance of my parents styling effortsno one had ever told them about Asian baby hair. My grandmother, who looks so much like my father with her wide smile, broad nose, and brown hair so dark it could almost be black like mine, reaches toward me as Dad props me up on her hospital bed.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"My mothers oncologist recommended that she undergo chemotherapy just to be sure, but the prognosis, we were both assured, was excellent. Her treatments would be covered by Medicare, which she had just qualified for based on age, sparing her one worry, at leastthere was no mountain of medical debt waiting on the other side of this crisis. The doctors said that after this I should be cured, she told me.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Relieved, I let my parents draw me into conversation about the kids. I had been so focused on getting my father to see a doctor, any doctor, that it was difficult for me to think beyond the promised appointment. Even after all Id heard about how sick he was, I couldnt imagine that he might be facing anything like his mothers illness, one that would render him a permanent patient and change my parents lives yet again.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I imagine one of them in the hospital, struggling to breathe, confused, terrified, alone. And that is always where my mind spins to a stop. As the days go by and virtual work and learning continue, our childrens discontent hardens into bored resignation. I start polling others about what I should do, partly because it is so hard to trust my own sanity and judgment.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When the kids and I call her another day, she is looking more like her old self, perhaps because shes wearing her glassesnearsighted as she is without them, Ive noticed she rarely has them on for our video callsand one of my fathers old Cleveland Browns T-shirts. I can tell that she is weak, and she has lost more weight, though she says that she still eats well.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"She sheepishly tells me that she used some of the money I gave her to buy new mini blinds. Thats perfect! I say. I dont care how she spends it, as long as its useful. Its hard for either of us to imagine her remarrying, or wanting to remarry. But as she begins to plan the next stage of her life without my father, I realize that I can picture her living out her own days in peaceand, more important, it seems that she can as well.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"All I can think about is how, at the end, I wasnt with her. She was the kind of mother who deserved to have her child there when she died. Knowing that I had her steadfast support, that she loved and believed in me no matter what, made me so much braver than I would have been otherwise. It made risks feel smaller; it made it possible for me to trust myself a little more.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"We cant wait to see the life youll build together. They never saw me as choosing one kind of family over another, one dream or one life over another. They could not imagine a future in which I did not pursue everything I wanted. * * * We drove all over the region with my parents that week, taking advantage of the good weather and the timing of our trip; mountain roads that would have been impassable during the winter months were clear and open in early fall, and the occasional drizzle didnt deter us.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"In her expression I read compassion, sadness, weariness. A deep well of concern. Her face was the first I ever glimpsed that looked anything like minefrom the moment of her birth, I knew that I was not alone. Now nearly twelve, she never resembles me more than when her steady brown eyes, my eyes, are like this, serious and appraising. She has always been her own person, frequently leaving me, the person who birthed her, wondering where she came from and who she will be.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"We would still belong to each other, but we would come to know one another differently in separation, in parting after parting. I didnt know what it would mean to leave, wouldnt begin to grasp it until my last night in my little blue childhood bedroom, a few months later, when I found I couldnt sleep for terror and wonder. I had spent most of my life in a small house in a small town, a Korean adoptee who knew I was loved but often felt as though I were living a life meant for someone else.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"You walked your path, you stayed faithful in your own way, and thats all I can ask. And who knows, she adds, maybe, after Im gone, well meet in prayer from time to time. Like the saints did. I hold her as tight as I dare, both of us now weeping. It is the first time in weeks, months, maybe years, that I have felt more like her child than a parent.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"More than once, I thought of what my mother said when she got Buster: Hes good for me. He gets me out of the house. No matter how I feel or what I want, I have to take him for his walk. Im never alone anymore. In the last weeks of her life, Buster was always with her, curled up beside her in the hospital bed.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I hear her voice speaking to me. And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reachits as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mothers sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my familynothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"It also feels as though Id be abandoning a household in shambles if I left. While Dan and I are both working from home now, as a scientist he is considered essential personnel and expects hell need to go back in eventually, and its not easy for either of us to get a full days work done with schools closed. It gets harder still when remote learning begins in earnest; our kids are grieving, isolated, irritable, and bored, and the last thing they want is to be assigned hours of busywork on a Chromebook.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Then I would fly back home and it would hit me anew, that cold prickle of awareness somewhere between my shoulder blades. I felt small and somehow trapped whenever I returned, as though I wouldnt be allowed to leave, even though I was only a visitor now, the interloper Id always looked like. My visits got shorter and shorter, and it was impossible to ignore the mingled guilt and relief I felt every time I boarded a flight headed east.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"But the chest tightness was a symptom of anxietylike the tension headaches that came and went, the perpetual stiffness in my neck and shoulders, the faint twitch under my left eye, the unsettled stomach that sometimes made it hard to eat. I wasnt having the sort of breakdown Id once imagined, one announced in more obvious signs of distress: trembling, shortness of breath, a sudden elevated heart rate, dizziness or weakness or chills.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I was better at hiding my diary, but my mother always found it eventually. No matter how many hours my parents might have spent wondering and watching me write, Im willing to bet they didnt give much thought to the notion that I might one day publish a memoir. I never quoted Czesaw Miosz to themWhen a writer is born into a family, the family is finishedthough I was tempted to do so, once or twice, as a joke.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I checked on friends and acquaintances and tried to call my aunt, who had inherited my parents house after my mother died. When I didnt get an answer, I texted Paula, who confirmed that she, her husband, and my aunt were safeand so was Buster. They were all hunkered down at Paulas, in sight of the flames but hoping they wouldnt need to evacuate.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Even before she spoke, I understood that my question was an intrusion on her hard-won peace, a knock she wasnt ready to answer. I dont need to talk about having cancer, Nicole, she told me. I lived through it. She did live through it. The breast cancer never returned. But her illness, the first serious one of her life, was a turning point for our family, an upheaval from which there would be no lasting recovery.",0,small
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"It took me a while to find my way home. Everyone else was asleep when I crept in, and I was relieved that I wouldnt need to face them yet. I crawled into bed and slept for a few hours before waking to the sound of Dan, Cindy, and Rick helping the kids get breakfast. I got dressed, found the car keys, and snuck out the back door without a word to anyonewhich, I supposed, I could add to the growing list of things I would need to apologize for.",0,small
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Wulf said, Was I really the only one who lived? It appears so. The rest were burned, drowned or frozen. I sent divers and ships to look. He closed his eyes. The Plague of fandauth is spreading, Einlek said. The Nameless One brought a sickness from the Womb of Fire, a plague that beset the people of Yikala. It must have returned. Whatever attacked our king, we can be sure it serves our enemy. We will fight. Nothing could defeat it, sire. No blade could have pierced its hide. And no Hrthi dies a feather death, Einlek said firmly. You were my uncles retainer.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I cling to faith as flame clings to a wick already curled and black. The Mother will see us through this, Esbar. The Priory, perhaps. What of you and I? Tunuva had never thought she would feel truly cold again, until Esbar uqNra asked her that question. That decision must be yours. Her throat constricted as she spoke. Nothing has changed for me. Esbar sank deeper into the chair. All these years I have watched you grieve, she said, and when you had hope, I failed to fan it. I was only afraid it was false hope, Tuva. You thought you were doing the right thing.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"After four years of Hran rule, the city still appeared Lacustrine, though the tents beyond its wall served as a strong reminder of the conquest. Furtia and Nayimathun landed near the High Perch. The stronghold bestrode a crag to the west, its sloping walls made tall and smooth. Oxen and horses, eagles and dragons pranced across its roofs, and a sun and moon gleamed on the doors, to be parted down the middle when they opened. The sheer mountains towered behind, offering an outlook worthy of the gods. Snow blew from the mountains, smoke from fires and bloomeries. Dumai climbed down.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"In exchange for his blade, the knight of Inysca had two conditions. First, he would see the people of Lasia convert to his new religion of Six Virtues. And second, when he returned to his own country, he would have Cleolind as his bride. Siyu stopped to clear her throat. Tunuva passed her a goblet of walnut milk, which she drank. And what then? Tunuva asked her. What did Cleolind say? When Siyu lay back down, she rested her head against Tunuva. She told her father to banish the knight, Siyu said. Desperate though their city was, she would not see her people on their knees for a foreign king  but when she went to meet her death, the knight followed.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Glorian entered to find only three of the Dukes Spiritual waiting for her. Your Grace, Lady Brangain said quietly. They all dipped their heads. Forgive us for disturbing you at this hour. We thought it right that you heard as soon as possible. Where is the Lord Protector? Glorian asked her. He rode out with Lord Damud and Lady Gladwin before dawn. They are on their way to instruct the earls and barons of the northern provinces, so they can muster your people to defend our queendom. He should be back before long. What is it you need to tell me? There is no easy way to say this, Lade Edith said softly.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"They have simply chosen to conserve their strength. Why did their strength wane? If a godsinger does not know the answer to that question, surely no one living does. An old boardwalk led into the lake, to the small island at its heart. The gods are benign, Emperor Jorodu said as they crossed, but they are not of our world. They prefer not to involve themselves in the politics and conflicts of humankind. Even if they were awake, they could not help us counter a threat like the Kuposa. That is why I needed you. Why have you brought me to this lake? I brought the elder of your two brothers first.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"In the event of his death, the heir to Inys may wed another relative of Queen Rozaria of Yscalin  in the first or second degree, specifically  within the next month. Usually the clause is included because one of the parties has some illness, or partakes in dangerous pursuits, Lade Edith said. A sensible precaution. Prince Therico had a fragile constitution. Lord Randroth set the document in question on the table. Two members of the House of Vetalda who fit the description were, tragically, killed with him. However, there is another, who is free to wed. If you were to accept him, it would mean we could proceed as planned.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"She did not have to stand here and try to outwit the River Lord. She did not have to become like him  and she had come so close, some days. This court had made her reckless, untrusting and hard; it had almost made her cruel. Now she remembered the godsinger of Mount Ipyeda, who had wished for nothing more than the life she already had. That godsinger had needed no throne to serve Kwiriki, or to help the people of Seiiki. After all, she had known Kwiriki before she ever set eyes on his throne. You are a kite, a rainbow, a rider.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Another silver Noziken. Dumai looked at them all, the whole belfry of courtiers. Her father had summoned her because she owed allegiance to no one. Now she saw that no one owed allegiance to her, either. I am alone. She stood at a great distance from herself. I am alone, with my foot in the fishnet. No, not alone. Outside, a dragon waited for her. The stone was tucked between her breasts. And when she heard the words in her head, they did not belong to a god, or a woman in a dream. It was her own voice. What are you doing? As that question filled her mind, a weight lifted.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Her first wild thought was that the gallery must have been walled up. Then the hanging was drawn back, and a stricken face appeared, cast into shadow. Who in Halgalant are you? Glorian demanded. Pain and embarrassment sharpened her voice. She had not thought to see anyone up here. The man  a young man, not much older than her  stared back at her in shock. My lady. Recovering, he lowered his head. Your pardon. Are you hurt? His accent was a flinty burr. She could have sworn it had the rime of the North on it. Hurt? Glorian snapped.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Gladwin Fynch (Lady Gladwin): Duchess of Temperance, descendant of the Knight of Temperance. Guma Vetalda (the Hermit of Hart Grove): High Prince of Yscalin and Duke of Kvuga, and twin brother of Rozaria III of Yscalin, born a few minutes after her. Uncle to the Donmato Alarico and granduncle to Princess Idrega and Prince Therico. He rules from the stronghold of Hart Grove and is the wealthiest man in Yscalin, thanks to the mines known collectively as the Ufarassus. Helisent Beck (Lady Helisent): A lady-in-waiting to Glorian Berethnet. Daughter of Lord Ordan Beck, the Dowager Earl of Goldenbirch. Idrega Vetalda: Princess of Yscalin and only daughter of the Donmato Alarico and his companion, Thederica Yelarigas.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I never understood what that meant before now. What if she used the same magic as Canthe? Esbar looked at it, her expression resolving. Hold the gate, she ordered their sisters. I need higher ground. Tunuva ran towards the cliffs with her. Royal tombs were carved into their western face. In their wake, the gates cracked open to let out a flood of Ersyri soldiers, roaring as they made a last foray. Those operating the catapults went up and down the cliffs on a wooden platform, pulled by chains. Esbar and Tunuva climbed on to it. Feeling their weight, someone above began to hoist them up, and as the platform swayed above the tombs, they saw the whole city, on fire from one end to the other.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Wulf grabbed whatever he could throw: weapons, two oars, a rack that must once have held meat, a table with a broken leg. With so many hands working together, the pile was soon high enough to give the creatures trouble breaking through. Fire archers came to set it ablaze. Its coming, a voice cried. The wyvern was back, and it had them all caught like fish in a net. Wulf looked up, his knees turning to slurry as he remembered Fredel. A harpoon ripped into it. The sound of its screech jolted him free. He stared as it rolled, like a foundering ship, and crashed down on a line of houses, blood spraying from under its wing.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I have left a warning for our sisters in the archives, telling them to be wary of strangers. What of the Inysh matter? Tunuva asked. Will you leave word of that in the archives, too? Yes. Her gaze turned distant. I will leave a tablet there, stating that the Queen of Inys is always to have a mage as her protector; that this is my ruling as Prioress of the Orange Tree  but I will allow our future sisters to interpret my reasons as they see fit. Thank you, Tunuva said. I do it to protect a part of you that will live on, Esbar told her, but also because a position in Inys will always be of value to us.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I mean to keep an eye on her. Yes, Im sure you would be happy to keep a close watch on a beautiful woman. Kanifa cocked a heavy eyebrow, a faint smile on his lips. Go to your mother, Dumai of Ipyeda. He continued down the corridor. She will cleanse you of such earthly thoughts. Dumai screened her grin behind her hair as she stepped into the room. She teased him, but in truth, Kanifa had never expressed interest in anyone. The mountain was his only love. The traveller lay on a mat, covered to his chin with bedding, feet snug in a heat trap.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Together, they proclaimed that the Lord Protector was in residence. The wind blew hard. Wulf coughed into a gloved hand. Inys might not be half as icy as Hrth in late winter, but their hideaway was damp and cold, and they dared not risk a fire. As the sun rose, Mara returned from her scouting, coming on foot from the hills. Wulf stared when he saw who was with her. While Thrit slept on, he stood aside to let them in. Lord Mansell folded him straight into his arms. Wulf, he breathed. Saint, I cant believe it. You dont even look hurt.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Then another face, pale and terrified. The memories were far away, so far they no longer held a clear shape, and ran like water. But he knew he had been to this part of the wood before. How had he escaped, the first time? He was laughing and the sun was bright, and he tasted honey like a prayer on his lips. Who are you? He stopped, a stitch ripping into his side. His hand shook so hard the candle guttered in the lantern. Light was glimmering through the trees. He stepped towards it, so entranced that all fear left his bones.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon," Unora smiled. Dumai would have liked that very much, I think. The Grand Empress glanced up at the dragon, who returned the look, blowing fog through her nostrils. You should be patient, Lady Nikeya, the Grand Empress said, the corners of her mouth tweaking. My granddaughter may yet guide you herself. The dead whisper through the crash of the waves. Sometimes, they may even choose to return to us  we, who are left on the shore. **** Thanks to Clan Kuposa, the House of Noziken had lived a long way from the coast. Nikeya would make no such mistake.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"She told me I disgraced you both. Esbar loves you with her soul, as we all do. She loves the Mother more. As we all must  but Siyu, I was there when Esbar gave birth to you. You have made her so proud over the years. This mistake is a small part of your life. It does not define it. Swallowing, Siyu managed a nod. Tunuva reached into her overskirt and took out the pouch. For you. So you can smell the forest, at least. Siyu undid the tie. When she saw the delicate blue petals in the pouch, she drew out the bloom and held it to her cheek, tears running again.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"As the wound smoked, he watched the glow leave its eye, an ember turning cold in its socket. His own eye had puffed shut. What had struck him, he had no idea. He had lost count of the talons scraping at his mail, the beaks striking his helm. He planted the end of his long axe in the sand. Wheezing from the smoke, he scraped his hair from his eyes and peered towards Bithandun, so tired he was almost drunk with it, swaying. The Silver Hall had not yet fallen, but its roof glowed with fire, and no amount of thrown water could quench it.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Tunuva wished Narha could comfort her, too  that her forebear could lean down from that column and brush away her nightmares. In the last one, Esbar had stabbed her in the heart, and she had woken in a sweat, convinced it was blood. She had not told Esbar. Across the hall, Esbar was taking her time at the rack. When she nodded to an Ersyri sword, the armourer removed its silver-mounted scabbard, wiped its blade with an oiled cloth, and handed it to her. As she held the sword aloft to inspect it, Tunuva recalled the cold twist of the knife in her dream.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"His need for power has grown in this chaos. This fire will have convinced him that Clan Kuposa must seize its chance to rule, while the gods are at their weakest. I can imagine him performing a noble sacrifice of the Noziken. Epabo, Dumai said, thank you, for everything. I will lead the gods to avert his folly. She marched from the tent, into the freezing night, to collect what she would need. Dumai. Unora caught up to her, Nikeya just behind. You mustnt go. It could be a trap, a way of drawing you into the open I cant leave Suzu at his mercy, Dumai said firmly.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I have sat here in the canyon for a week, to warn those who would come too close. I cant go back. I would sooner starve than He made the sign of the sword, his hand trembling. No soul should enter Halgalant that way. These people look to you for guidance, Saintsman, Regny sneered. And you cower down here? I am a sanctarian, not a warrior or a physician. Wulf drew up beside Regny. Sanctarian, he said, where is the former snowseer, the Issn? Locked into her home. So is anyone with sense. Regny tacked her gaze to the path. We must see the village for ourselves, she said, so I may describe this sickness to King Bardholt.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"The sun has risen. Her voice was bereft of hope. The wyverns can see the moor clearly now. I dont think it will be long before our soldiers are dead. Even with the ones who came from Paupers Henge? Its not enough, Glorian. Theyre so tired. Tears streaked her cheeks. I feel just as I did when you fell off your horse. Youre in danger again, and I cant save you. I cant save Sabran. Its my fault. I should not have insisted on coming here. You did it for Inys. Adela brought fresh candles. Glorian slipped into a weary doze, Sabran gathered to her heart.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon," Glorian drew herself up. Mother retires after eventide. I will need to be at the spyhole by then. She grimaced. Lets not tell Jules. Shell only worry. They looked at one another. Or Adela, they agreed in unison. **** After the evening meal, she and Helisent changed and walked to the Royal Sanctuary. Sir Bramel and Dame Erda closed the doors behind them, leaving Glorian to her supposed reflection. Take this. Helisent took a fire pouch from under her cloak. Do you know how to use it? Of course. When Helisent canted an eyebrow, Glorian sighed. I am aware I lack certain practical skills as a royal, but do you truly think a princess of the North cant light a fire? I sometimes forget youve a claim to two thrones.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Every head on the ship turned. Bardholt placed a hand on the side. Archers, he called. Along with half the seafarers, Regny nocked an arrow. Steady. Sire, what comes? a voice said. Let us see. Bardholt narrowed his eyes. It has been a long time since I last heard drums. Not drums, Wulf thought at first, but Bardholt would know better. After all, he had been to war. It could be the Ments. Perhaps even the Vatten. The wedding might have been their chance to lure Bardholt to the sea, where they were strong. Perhaps they were tired of being his stewards, and even an Yscali princess could not temper their ambition.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"By the light of the low-burning fires, they shared tales of their deeds, raising their cups to those who had ascended to Halgalant. Hunger was the unwelcome guest. Where food had once been rich, now there was only simple fare, even for the king and his guard. You all fought like the Saint himself today, Einlek said, when they had scraped every plate. None more than Gthur Wyrmkiller, whose harpoon felled the beast. For the first time, the guests raised their voices in a cheer. Gthur was pounded on the back. In the past, our people longed for a glorious death in battle, Einlek called.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"What makes you think I would have you, Lady Sabran? Her name was a dark thrum in his throat. How do you know I dont already have a consort in my own kingdom? Because I saw how you looked at me in the throne room. (He had not said no.) And how often. King Bardholt offered no reply. Sabran stood tall before him, for she was not her mother. I think, she said, that you are a man familiar with having what you want. This time, you need not seize it with blood and force. I offer it all to you.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Unora took a layer of cloth from the middle of the table, revealing the oily blue stone. Empress Mokwo wrote of a stone that could command the waters and the winds. Even the gods heeded its call, she said. It was said to resemble a moon, so the Grand Empress did expect it to be pale. Dumai watched her face. It had been a long time since she had seen her mother look nervous. The moon has been known to turn blue. Emperor Jorodu wore a strange expression of his own. Mokwo claimed a human could use this stone, but that only a chosen few could wake it  that for others, it would turn to dead rock.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"With surprising care, she drew a thread of damp hair between her fingers, teasing out a pine needle. Are you certain you dont want me to comb this, Princess? Dumai could feel her own breath betraying her. A warm drift in her darkest waters. Daughter, have you lost your senses? I will manage, she said, starting to draw away. Wait. You said I couldnt style it for this court. Oh, yes  a messenger came at noon. Nikeya smiled. Queen Arkoro will see us tomorrow morning. Dumai stared at her in exasperation. Did you not think to tell me that earlier? I must have been distracted.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Dumai stared at the writing. Tonra speaks of a comet that will come in the twelfth year of the fifth century  next year  to cool the risen fire. This must be the answer. A comet. His expression changed. A comet is what keeps the balance in check. Father might know of it  but if this is true, this time of fire will not last for ever, just as Master Kiprun said. It is a wheel, always circling. It means we only need survive until this coming spring. Easier said than done. Kanifa coughed. Dumai, weve stayed too long.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"And she understood what the dragon wanted. With a hundred thousand eyes on her, she reached out with trembling fingers. A living dragon, slippery as a fish, real and alive beneath her palm. There was kinship in that touch, and strength. Furtia nudged back with her snout. Come. She made a sound like distant thunder, and Dumai took another step. She closed her eyes, feeling a pull, a likeness, a want. The black scales were too slick to hold without slipping. Finding she was unafraid, she sank her hands into the waterfall of manehair. Her fingers closed in the heavy, oily mass, which smelled of steel and seaweed.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Furtia and I will get her away. Taugran is much stronger than Furtia, Nikeya protested. You know this, Dumai. Not for long. I feel the coming of the star. It was true. Her awareness of it was taut and strong, a string pulled along the neck of a lute, tuned to something that moved closer by the hour. Nikeya, Unora said quietly, touching her shoulder, will you leave us a moment, and watch over Epabo? Of course. Nikeya dealt Dumai a concerned look and went back to the tent. Unora took Dumai by the cheek. Do not go to Muysima. I have to I wished, Dumai.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Dumai was frozen stiff. She could smell the beast, its wrongness, and the closer it came, the harder her heart pounded. Its eyes were fixed on her. Great one, stop! Her heels slipped as more briny water bubbled up beneath her. Furtia Stop, its too strong! Furtia opened her jaws in a roar. Then a wave of hot air struck her, and so did a terrible iron horn, scraping along her side. The white light in her crest hissed out. The sound that followed was like nothing Dumai had ever heard  the screech of the wind, threatening to rip her eardrums.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I had to count the zeros several times before I could believe it. You did it, my mother said. She tried to smile, but we both wound up crying instead. As we celebrated, I wasnt thinking about how lonely I might feel, or how much I would miss my family. I couldnt comprehend what it would mean to attain that first foothold in a world they would be unable to follow me into. I didnt know that I would spend my early months on campus feeling as though Id wandered into another country, surrounded by students who never had to worry about buying books or finding somewhere to go when the dorms closed for a holiday.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"A country that first abandons and then condemns people without money who have the temerity to get sick, accusing them of causing their own deaths. It is still hard for me not to think of my fathers death as a kind of negligent homicide, facilitated and sped by the states failure to fulfill its most basic responsibilities to him and others like him. With our broken safety net, our strained systems of care and support, the deep and corrosive inequalities we have yet to address, its no wonder that so many of us find ourselves alone, struggling to get the help we need when we or our loved ones are suffering.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"But had I been wrong to feel that way? They certainly never saw their burdens as mine to share, instead choosing to shield me from them for as long as they could. They were my parents: they looked after me, not the other way around. * * * The lack of air-conditioning in my childhood home was bearable because we could open our windows at nightexcept during wildfire season, when we might occasionally suffer and sweat in the hot, tightly sealed rooms of our house. The fires rarely threatened more densely populated areas, and I never worried about them reaching our house.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When I was at my most anxious, fretting about one or both of my kids, Mom would always tell me to relax, take a deep breath, stop worrying. The girls are going to be okay. It was no empty, unthinking reassurance she offered; she believed it, every time. I couldnt understand her certainty, and sometimes, I admit, resented itshe was a parent, too, and as anxious as I was. Didnt she understand that it was impossible for me to let go of my fears, lay down my burdens? Now I would give almost anything to hear her tell me not to worry again.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When I lived here, I used to walk to another field near our old house to watch the sky darken above gold-limned hills. Sometimes, driving home in the evening, Id pull over to admire the viewthe riotous colors of sunset, the slow-deepening blue of the mountains as the light receded. Ive relaxed at peaceful eastern lakes and walked along Atlantic beaches, but have yet to find any substitute for these mountains.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When a friend asked if I minded that my parents were selling the home Id grown up in, I scoffed. The last person to live in my childhood bedroom hadnt even been me, but a friend of minemy parents, with typical openhandedness, had let her stay with them rent-free for a year and a half after her own parents kicked her out. There were things about the house Id been fond of: the sprawling, shady backyard that had once contained my rickety old swing set; my room with its blue walls and bursting bookshelves and my cats favorite scratching post; the minuscule spare bedroom that I was eventually permitted to turn into a writing space, nearly every square inch filled with our lumpy blue futon and the giant desk I had begged my mother to buy at a yard sale.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"The medication hed been prescribed was expensive without insurance and also upset his stomach, so he stopped taking it, saying that he couldnt work and serve food all day while feeling nauseated. As restaurant manager, he was usually the last one who got to take a break or eat lunch, and when he did get a meal, the food most readily available were the pizzas he helped make. He had little free time for regular exercise, no extra money to give to a gym or a nutritionist, and unless he felt very ill, he did not go to the doctor. During the long years when he could trace no significant or debilitating issues to his condition, I doubt he had either the luxury or the inclination to worry much about his healthor his lack of health care.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"If you really knew and didnt tell us, that was a real dick move, Dad. He did look peaceful, as if he had welcomed death, or at least been ready for it. When we approached to say our final goodbyes, Mom, mostly cried out by then, put her arm around my shoulders, her solid warmth a familiar comfort as always. Dont despair, she told me. This is our hope in the Resurrection. The words might have upset me coming from anyone else in that church, anyone else in the world. But I felt her sorrow as something deeper and more powerful than my own, a great river spilling its banks.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Though Ive often wished that we could have come up with an argument that would have changed his mind, my mother believed nothing either of us could say would have swayed him. She said that he remembered his mothers agony after organ rejection, and in the end he believed that neither dialysis nor a transplant would give him a long life. The dialysis did its job, as it had for his mother, first saving and then extending his life. But the ongoing treatments left him drained and far more vulnerable to other illnesses and infections. His immune system was compromised; he was constantly getting sick.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Four months after my mother died, a fire started fifteen minutes from her neighborhood. High winds carried the sparks far afield, allowing the blaze to grow and fan out for miles. Unlike the wildfires I remember from childhood, this one roared parallel to some of the busiest roads in the area, ravaging parkland, businesses, and thousands of homes. I was shocked to see news of the runaway destruction, although California wildfires had been in the news for weeks, and Id heard about the terrible air quality in the Bay Area, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver. My home region lacks a major urban center and rarely draws outside media attention.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I cry while I eat or drink. I cry in the shower, and when I lie down to try to sleep. Even when I am worn out, too hoarse for my sobs to make much of a sound, the tears keep coming, silently drifting down my cheeks. All I can think about is how, at the end, I wasnt with her. She was the kind of mother who deserved to have her child there when she died. Knowing that I had her steadfast support, that she loved and believed in me no matter what, made me so much braver than I would have been otherwise.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Thats what she meant when she told me, as a child, that I could never disappoint her. Thats why she and my father always said it didnt matter where I went, what I did with my life, what I accomplishedthey would always be proud of me. Thats why she believes that there is nothing for her to forgive now. I can choose to accept her at her word or not, keep chastising myself or not, but the truth is that this is what she has long believed: I am her daughter, so I am enough. When she is gone, I wonder, can I possibly learn to be enough for myself? What would it meanhow would it feelif I were? She has asked me what shes done with her life, how she can stand before God without fear.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"All I would have focused on was that our expected family contribution was zero. Although many people identify as middle-of-the-road, middle-class, average Americans, there are differences between a working-class and a middle-class existence, and these differences can be far from subtle. If you grow up as I did and happen to be very fortunate, as I was, your family might sacrifice much so that you can go to college. Youll feel grateful for every subsequent opportunity you get, for the degrees and open doors and better-paying jobs (if you can find them), even as an unexpected, sometimes painful distance yawns between you and the place you came fromand many will expect you to express that gratitude, using your story or your accomplishments to attack those who werent so lucky.",0,medium

My grandmother, who looks so much like my father with her wide smile, broad nose, and brown hair so dark it could almost be black like mine, reaches toward me as Dad props me up on her hospital bed.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"My mothers oncologist recommended that she undergo chemotherapy just to be sure, but the prognosis, we were both assured, was excellent. Her treatments would be covered by Medicare, which she had just qualified for based on age, sparing her one worry, at leastthere was no mountain of medical debt waiting on the other side of this crisis. The doctors said that after this I should be cured, she told me. She sounded surprised. I understood why. After shed recovered from breast cancer, her doctors had steadfastly avoided using that word; they would say that she was in remission, or that there was no further evidence of disease.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Relieved, I let my parents draw me into conversation about the kids. I had been so focused on getting my father to see a doctor, any doctor, that it was difficult for me to think beyond the promised appointment. Even after all Id heard about how sick he was, I couldnt imagine that he might be facing anything like his mothers illness, one that would render him a permanent patient and change my parents lives yet again. He needed help to better manage his diabetes, I thought, or maybe he needed a different medication. The community clinic was the first step; soon, wed learn how to make him well again.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I imagine one of them in the hospital, struggling to breathe, confused, terrified, alone. And that is always where my mind spins to a stop. As the days go by and virtual work and learning continue, our childrens discontent hardens into bored resignation. I start polling others about what I should do, partly because it is so hard to trust my own sanity and judgment. My questions are always the same, but a few patient friends pick up every single time to listen to me run through the terrible choices.

I can tell that she is weak, and she has lost more weight, though she says that she still eats well. From the sound of her voice, she has recently woken from a nap. She holds up the flowers we sent her and thanks us, but even from the other side of a screen I can see that the online shop I ordered from has failed us.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"She sheepishly tells me that she used some of the money I gave her to buy new mini blinds. Thats perfect! I say. I dont care how she spends it, as long as its useful. Its hard for either of us to imagine her remarrying, or wanting to remarry. But as she begins to plan the next stage of her life without my father, I realize that I can picture her living out her own days in peaceand, more important, it seems that she can as well.

Knowing that I had her steadfast support, that she loved and believed in me no matter what, made me so much braver than I would have been otherwise. It made risks feel smaller; it made it possible for me to trust myself a little more.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"We cant wait to see the life youll build together. They never saw me as choosing one kind of family over another, one dream or one life over another. They could not imagine a future in which I did not pursue everything I wanted. * * * We drove all over the region with my parents that week, taking advantage of the good weather and the timing of our trip; mountain roads that would have been impassable during the winter months were clear and open in early fall, and the occasional drizzle didnt deter us. Mom made us pose for pictures in front of a lighthouse, at the seaside botanical gardens she loved, on a bridge stretching over a rushing river gorge.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"In her expression I read compassion, sadness, weariness. A deep well of concern. Her face was the first I ever glimpsed that looked anything like minefrom the moment of her birth, I knew that I was not alone. Now nearly twelve, she never resembles me more than when her steady brown eyes, my eyes, are like this, serious and appraising. She has always been her own person, frequently leaving me, the person who birthed her, wondering where she came from and who she will be. And yet I know she is who she is in part because I am her mother, just as I am who I am because of mine.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"We would still belong to each other, but we would come to know one another differently in separation, in parting after parting. I didnt know what it would mean to leave, wouldnt begin to grasp it until my last night in my little blue childhood bedroom, a few months later, when I found I couldnt sleep for terror and wonder. I had spent most of my life in a small house in a small town, a Korean adoptee who knew I was loved but often felt as though I were living a life meant for someone else.

And who knows, she adds, maybe, after Im gone, well meet in prayer from time to time. Like the saints did. I hold her as tight as I dare, both of us now weeping. It is the first time in weeks, months, maybe years, that I have felt more like her child than a parent. This is your final battle, you know that. You should have gotten so much more time, I say. But if you cant have that, then I want you to be able to feel some peace, and have time to prepare, the way Dad did.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"More than once, I thought of what my mother said when she got Buster: Hes good for me. He gets me out of the house. No matter how I feel or what I want, I have to take him for his walk. Im never alone anymore. In the last weeks of her life, Buster was always with her, curled up beside her in the hospital bed. My aunt takes care of him now, in the house he used to share with my mom, and I like to think that he remembers her as well as he canthe rooms may yet hold traces of her that a dogs sharp nose can sniff out.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I hear her voice speaking to me. And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reachits as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mothers sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my familynothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed.",0,medium

While Dan and I are both working from home now, as a scientist he is considered essential personnel and expects hell need to go back in eventually, and its not easy for either of us to get a full days work done with schools closed. It gets harder still when remote learning begins in earnest; our kids are grieving, isolated, irritable, and bored, and the last thing they want is to be assigned hours of busywork on a Chromebook.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Then I would fly back home and it would hit me anew, that cold prickle of awareness somewhere between my shoulder blades. I felt small and somehow trapped whenever I returned, as though I wouldnt be allowed to leave, even though I was only a visitor now, the interloper Id always looked like. My visits got shorter and shorter, and it was impossible to ignore the mingled guilt and relief I felt every time I boarded a flight headed east. Campus was where I had a life, a purpose, new ideas to absorbwhere things were always changing, where no one stared at me when I entered a room, where I no longer questioned the fact that I belonged.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"But the chest tightness was a symptom of anxietylike the tension headaches that came and went, the perpetual stiffness in my neck and shoulders, the faint twitch under my left eye, the unsettled stomach that sometimes made it hard to eat. I wasnt having the sort of breakdown Id once imagined, one announced in more obvious signs of distress: trembling, shortness of breath, a sudden elevated heart rate, dizziness or weakness or chills. Not until the pandemic hit and I suddenly felt like a rat trapped in a maze, frantically circling and unable to escape, did it occur to me that I might be experiencing a constant, low-level panic attack, a slow but inexorable spiral from which there would be no escape so long as my mother suffered and I could not get to her.",0,medium
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I was better at hiding my diary, but my mother always found it eventually.

I never quoted Czesaw Miosz to themWhen a writer is born into a family, the family is finishedthough I was tempted to do so, once or twice, as a joke. Of course, I wasnt born into our family at alla fact that always mattered more to me than it did to them.",0,medium

When I didnt get an answer, I texted Paula, who confirmed that she, her husband, and my aunt were safeand so was Buster. They were all hunkered down at Paulas, in sight of the flames but hoping they wouldnt need to evacuate. They couldnt say whether my parents home had survived.

We watched shaky video footage shot by local residents; paused and zoomed in on aerial video shared by local news outlets, trying to identify my parents neighborhood.",0,medium

I dont need to talk about having cancer, Nicole, she told me. I lived through it. She did live through it. The breast cancer never returned. But her illness, the first serious one of her life, was a turning point for our family, an upheaval from which there would be no lasting recovery. * * * Once, while visiting my parents, I asked my father what he was proudest of in life.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"It took me a while to find my way home. Everyone else was asleep when I crept in, and I was relieved that I wouldnt need to face them yet.

I got dressed, found the car keys, and snuck out the back door without a word to anyonewhich, I supposed, I could add to the growing list of things I would need to apologize for. I was too ashamed to tell my mother about my outburst, or that I had come to see her on my own this morning because I wanted her to do something for me; I couldnt have said what.",0,medium
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Wulf said, Was I really the only one who lived? It appears so. The rest were burned, drowned or frozen. I sent divers and ships to look. He closed his eyes. The Plague of fandauth is spreading, Einlek said. The Nameless One brought a sickness from the Womb of Fire, a plague that beset the people of Yikala. It must have returned. Whatever attacked our king, we can be sure it serves our enemy. We will fight. Nothing could defeat it, sire. No blade could have pierced its hide. And no Hrthi dies a feather death, Einlek said firmly. You were my uncles retainer. Now he is dead, you may leave with honour  or you can swear to me. A son of Hrth deserves a hall. Wulf clenched his jaw, his eyes aching. If you accept, sail to Ascalun, Einlek said. My cousin has relinquished her birthright to me, and for that, I owe her succour. You were on the Conviction. You can swear that Queen Sabran is dead, which will strengthen Glorians legitimacy. You can help her, Wulf. You want me to go back on the Ashen Sea. Yes. Sire, I dont know if I can. Dont let that fear take root, or youll never move again. Einlek leaned forward, his knuckles blanching on the throne. Hear me. Glorian is only sixteen, and she is now the divine head of Virtudom.

Tunuva had never thought she would feel truly cold again, until Esbar uqNra asked her that question. That decision must be yours. Her throat constricted as she spoke. Nothing has changed for me. Esbar sank deeper into the chair. All these years I have watched you grieve, she said, and when you had hope, I failed to fan it. I was only afraid it was false hope, Tuva. You thought you were doing the right thing. Desperation made me foolish. We can all be foolish when it comes to love. Esbar breathed out. Armul  Wulfert  is welcome here. I must confess, I am curious to see him. And glad to have a little more of you. All at once, her eyes were brimming. Esbar had not wept in so long. Tunuva reached across the table and took her by the hand, interlocking their fingers. Is it enough? Esbar asked her in a strained voice. Is our life enough for you now, Tuva? It was always enough. I just wanted the truth. Esbar tightened her grasp. I would not live another day without you by my side, she said in a whisper. Be with me. Forgive me, and I will give you the same grace.

A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"In exchange for his blade, the knight of Inysca had two conditions. First, he would see the people of Lasia convert to his new religion of Six Virtues. And second, when he returned to his own country, he would have Cleolind as his bride. Siyu stopped to clear her throat. Tunuva passed her a goblet of walnut milk, which she drank. And what then? Tunuva asked her. What did Cleolind say? When Siyu lay back down, she rested her head against Tunuva. She told her father to banish the knight, Siyu said. Desperate though their city was, she would not see her people on their knees for a foreign king  but when she went to meet her death, the knight followed. And when Cleolind was bound to a stone, and the Nameless One emerged from the foul water to claim his payment, the knight faced him. But Galian Berethnet  that was his name  was a coward and a fool. The fumes and fire overcame him. Cleolind took up his sword. From the acrid shore of Lake Jakpa, deep into the Lasian Basin, she fought the Beast of the Mountain, tracking him to his lair. There, Cleolind was astonished, for in the valley grew a befruited tree, taller than any she had ever seen. That image appeared on many walls in the Priory. The tree, its golden oranges, the red beast twined around its trunk. They fought, Siyu said, for a day and a night.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Glorian entered to find only three of the Dukes Spiritual waiting for her. Your Grace, Lady Brangain said quietly. They all dipped their heads. Forgive us for disturbing you at this hour. We thought it right that you heard as soon as possible. Where is the Lord Protector? Glorian asked her. He rode out with Lord Damud and Lady Gladwin before dawn. They are on their way to instruct the earls and barons of the northern provinces, so they can muster your people to defend our queendom. He should be back before long. What is it you need to tell me? There is no easy way to say this, Lade Edith said softly. Prince Therico of Yscalin is dead. The words woke her like a fall through ice. How? As I believe you were informed, the wyrms flew south after their attack on the Leas. From what we understand, they fell upon the Yscali port of Tagrida and burned it almost to the ground. Prince Therico was aboard one of the ships docked there. It took Glorian a moment to digest the news. He had been just days away from Inys. May he find his place at the Great Table. She caved into a chair. Sixteen is no age to die. No, Your Grace. What is to be done, then? Glorian finally asked. You all agreed that I should have an heir as soon as possible. There is a way to remedy the situation quickly, Lord Randroth said, dabbing his nose.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"They have simply chosen to conserve their strength. Why did their strength wane? If a godsinger does not know the answer to that question, surely no one living does. An old boardwalk led into the lake, to the small island at its heart. The gods are benign, Emperor Jorodu said as they crossed, but they are not of our world. They prefer not to involve themselves in the politics and conflicts of humankind. Even if they were awake, they could not help us counter a threat like the Kuposa. That is why I needed you. Why have you brought me to this lake? I brought the elder of your two brothers first. In the Empire of the Twelve Lakes, the Imperial Dragon chose a worthy heir from the House of Lakseng, when she was still awake. Here, the firstborn usually succeeds their parent, but I think the Lacustrine had it right. After all, we are made of water, and there is no better judge of water than a god. Dumai stopped when she saw what waited on the island. A large bell, cast in bronze. Father, she said, its forbidden. Not for us. In fact, there is a way for us to wake them all, if Seiiki ever had great need. You lived beneath it your whole life. The Queen Bell. Yes. If the Queen Bell rings, there are people across Seiiki who will strike all the others. Her father laid a hand on the bronze.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"In the event of his death, the heir to Inys may wed another relative of Queen Rozaria of Yscalin  in the first or second degree, specifically  within the next month. Usually the clause is included because one of the parties has some illness, or partakes in dangerous pursuits, Lade Edith said. A sensible precaution. Prince Therico had a fragile constitution. Lord Randroth set the document in question on the table. Two members of the House of Vetalda who fit the description were, tragically, killed with him. However, there is another, who is free to wed. If you were to accept him, it would mean we could proceed as planned. We would not have to seek other candidates or negotiate favourable terms, which will prove almost impossible in wartime. We would preserve our historic union with Queen Rozaria. I thought all her other grandchildren married, Glorian said. You had it right, Queen Glorian. Lade Edith loosened their collar, looking a little faint. Forgive me. I truly do not believe we should consider this, but the Lord Protector is in favour, Lord Randroth finished. He knows the man well, and vouches for his conduct. Glorian nodded. Who is it? Prince Guma Vetalda. Florell, who had been waiting outside the Council Chamber, now ventured into it. Prince Guma, she echoed. Lord Randroth, you cant possibly be talking about the Duke of Kvuga. You are not permitted to enter the Council Chamber, Lady Florell.",0,large

That godsinger had needed no throne to serve Kwiriki, or to help the people of Seiiki. After all, she had known Kwiriki before she ever set eyes on his throne. You are a kite, a rainbow, a rider. The realisation tilted the corners of her lips. Where have you ever belonged but the sky? Before she could think better of it, she walked towards the throne and knelt, taking Suzumai by the hand. Your Majesty, she said, I love and respect you, as your big sister. I will not ask for the Rainbow Throne. You have every right to sit on it, too. She touched her cheek. I must leave again, for a little while, but I will always come back. Suzumai swallowed, eyes shimmering. You promised you wouldnt go away again. I know. Dumai tightened her hold on her hand. Im sorry. Will you keep me safe? Yes, Suzumai whispered. Dumai looked at the River Lord, whose face betrayed his curiosity. He was trying to predict her next move.

Now she saw that no one owed allegiance to her, either. I am alone. She stood at a great distance from herself. I am alone, with my foot in the fishnet. No, not alone. Outside, a dragon waited for her. The stone was tucked between her breasts. And when she heard the words in her head, they did not belong to a god, or a woman in a dream. It was her own voice. What are you doing? As that question filled her mind, a weight lifted. She did not have to fight this battle. She did not have to stand here and try to outwit the River Lord. She did not have to become like him  and she had come so close, some days. This court had made her reckless, untrusting and hard; it had almost made her cruel.

Who in Halgalant are you? Glorian demanded. Pain and embarrassment sharpened her voice. She had not thought to see anyone up here. The man  a young man, not much older than her  stared back at her in shock. My lady. Recovering, he lowered his head. Your pardon. Are you hurt? His accent was a flinty burr. She could have sworn it had the rime of the North on it. Hurt? Glorian snapped. I am vexed, by your presence. Why are you lurking up here in the dark? He seemed at a loss for words. She knew she was being rude, but she needed him to get out of the way, before she fainted on him. Her bone hurt so badly it made her sight prickle. A second face looked out from behind the young man. A woman, about the same age, brown hair plaited over her pale forehead. When Glorian realised what she must have interrupted, she flushed. Unless you two are wed, you should not be trysting. She drew herself up to her full, considerable height, her arm throbbing. Off with you, or Queen Sabran will hear of this. We werent the woman started, but the man cut her off. Aye, my lady.

A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I never understood what that meant before now. What if she used the same magic as Canthe? Esbar looked at it, her expression resolving. Hold the gate, she ordered their sisters. I need higher ground. Tunuva ran towards the cliffs with her. Royal tombs were carved into their western face. In their wake, the gates cracked open to let out a flood of Ersyri soldiers, roaring as they made a last foray. Those operating the catapults went up and down the cliffs on a wooden platform, pulled by chains. Esbar and Tunuva climbed on to it. Feeling their weight, someone above began to hoist them up, and as the platform swayed above the tombs, they saw the whole city, on fire from one end to the other. Below, their sisters grew smaller, beating away the horde at the gates. Theyre coming from the north, Esbar said, watching. Tunuva nodded. She looked down at her cloak, once white, and found it soaked in blood. At the top, they stepped off the platform to find the city guard cranking down the arm of the largest catapult, Izi observing them. From here, starlight could be glimpsed through the smoke. Izi, get to the tombs to recover, Esbar told her. Youve fought enough. Im fine, Prioress That was an order. With a nod of defeat, Izi went to the platform, holding her side. Tunuva craned her neck to see the catapults, which stood as tall as old bone towers.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I have left a warning for our sisters in the archives, telling them to be wary of strangers. What of the Inysh matter? Tunuva asked. Will you leave word of that in the archives, too? Yes. Her gaze turned distant. I will leave a tablet there, stating that the Queen of Inys is always to have a mage as her protector; that this is my ruling as Prioress of the Orange Tree  but I will allow our future sisters to interpret my reasons as they see fit. Thank you, Tunuva said. I do it to protect a part of you that will live on, Esbar told her, but also because a position in Inys will always be of value to us. We can see into the land of the Deceiver. I agree. Let our sisters know what he did to the Mother, so they might always guard the truth. The Red Damsels needed no flame to fight. Each sister was a living blade. They would hunt the wyrms now, to the same places they had forced humans into for almost a year. They would stalk them to the deepest caves, the highest roosts and farthest wastes, to ensure they never rose again. An ichneumon pup snuffled towards them. Esbar nudged Tunuva with her shoulder.

A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I mean to keep an eye on her. Yes, Im sure you would be happy to keep a close watch on a beautiful woman. Kanifa cocked a heavy eyebrow, a faint smile on his lips. Go to your mother, Dumai of Ipyeda. He continued down the corridor. She will cleanse you of such earthly thoughts. Dumai screened her grin behind her hair as she stepped into the room. She teased him, but in truth, Kanifa had never expressed interest in anyone. The mountain was his only love. The traveller lay on a mat, covered to his chin with bedding, feet snug in a heat trap. He was about sixty, grey woven through his thick hair, which framed a brown and solemn face. Unora was nearby, watching a kettle. While there were guests in the temple, she was obliged to wear the grey veil of the Maiden Officiant, even outside the rituals she led. The Maiden Officiant acted as the understudy and representative of the Supreme Officiant. While the latter was always a member of the imperial family, the former was usually not of noble birth. Her veil symbolised the waterline between the earthly and celestial realms. There you are. Unora patted the floor. Come. Dumai knelt beside her. Have you found out who he is?

A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Together, they proclaimed that the Lord Protector was in residence. The wind blew hard. Wulf coughed into a gloved hand. Inys might not be half as icy as Hrth in late winter, but their hideaway was damp and cold, and they dared not risk a fire. As the sun rose, Mara returned from her scouting, coming on foot from the hills. Wulf stared when he saw who was with her. While Thrit slept on, he stood aside to let them in. Lord Mansell folded him straight into his arms. Wulf, he breathed. Saint, I cant believe it. You dont even look hurt. I missed you, Pa. When Lord Mansell finally drew back, his eyes were stony with resolve. I came from Langarth, he said to them both. Father brought me abreast of your doubts. He set down a basket. Last night, a messenger arrived from Lady Helisent  she paid him for his haste. Queen Glorian had word that Lord Robart means to stay here until the Feast of Early Spring. How does he explain that? Wulf folded his arms. The regent should be with the queen. He claims to be taking stock of the trees in the haithwood. To see how much timber Inys has for weapons. Wulf rubbed his stubbled jaw.

A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Then another face, pale and terrified. The memories were far away, so far they no longer held a clear shape, and ran like water. But he knew he had been to this part of the wood before. How had he escaped, the first time? He was laughing and the sun was bright, and he tasted honey like a prayer on his lips. Who are you? He stopped, a stitch ripping into his side. His hand shook so hard the candle guttered in the lantern. Light was glimmering through the trees. He stepped towards it, so entranced that all fear left his bones. Above him, a long mark was daubed on an oak, silver and faded, sending a sickly glow over the trunks. Even though its shape was strange, it was familiar. He knew, then, to turn north. A few more paces, to another tree. As he approached, more marks flared to life on the trees, each one extending his path through the blackness. At the end, there was light, both white and gold. Wulf glanced over his shoulder. He had thought Lord Robart would have heard the commotion with the wolves, but the wood was so gathered and dense, there was no trace of anyone else. It occurred to him that he might not find any of them again. There must be thousands of skeletons in these woods. Keeping low, he moved into the undergrowth. He bent a branch aside, and it was suddenly there, the place he had sought  a clearing surrounded by hulking oaks and beeches.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Unora smiled. Dumai would have liked that very much, I think. The Grand Empress glanced up at the dragon, who returned the look, blowing fog through her nostrils. You should be patient, Lady Nikeya, the Grand Empress said, the corners of her mouth tweaking. My granddaughter may yet guide you herself. The dead whisper through the crash of the waves. Sometimes, they may even choose to return to us  we, who are left on the shore. **** Thanks to Clan Kuposa, the House of Noziken had lived a long way from the coast. Nikeya would make no such mistake. Ginura was the last place Dumai had visited, apart from the city where she had fallen. Once they had received the order in person from the Grand Empress, the few surviving members of the Council of State  most had been in the palace when it burned  had confirmed her as Warlord of Seiiki. Nikeya knew she would have to work hard to win over Lady Mithara and Lord Tajorin. That is one of your gifts, a distant impression of Dumai reminded her. The Nadama were flocking to her court at Ginura Castle. Nikeya meant to bring greater change to Seiiki, as the years went on  but she would still have to be slow, always slow. She would rule for a time as if she were queen, and see what other ways opened for her. The remaining Kuposa had not been pleased with her choice of name.",0,large

As we all must  but Siyu, I was there when Esbar gave birth to you. You have made her so proud over the years. This mistake is a small part of your life. It does not define it. Swallowing, Siyu managed a nod. Tunuva reached into her overskirt and took out the pouch. For you. So you can smell the forest, at least. Siyu undid the tie. When she saw the delicate blue petals in the pouch, she drew out the bloom and held it to her cheek, tears running again. She had always loved dayflowers. Thank you. She sank against Tunuva. Youre always so good to me, Tuva. Even when Im a fool. Tunuva kissed the top of her head. Even as she did, she remembered that Esbar could never be so tender with Siyu. She and Imsurin did not have that freedom. I would like something in exchange, Tunuva said. I would like you to tell me a story. What story? The one that matters most. Tunuva stroked her hair. Come. The way Imin used to tell it to you. With a tiny smile, Siyu shifted across the bed, so Tunuva could lean into the bolsters. Will you do the fire? Siyu asked her. Of course. Siyu wiped her face once more, nestling close. There is a Womb of Fire that roils beneath the world, she began.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"As the wound smoked, he watched the glow leave its eye, an ember turning cold in its socket. His own eye had puffed shut. What had struck him, he had no idea. He had lost count of the talons scraping at his mail, the beaks striking his helm. He planted the end of his long axe in the sand. Wheezing from the smoke, he scraped his hair from his eyes and peered towards Bithandun, so tired he was almost drunk with it, swaying. The Silver Hall had not yet fallen, but its roof glowed with fire, and no amount of thrown water could quench it. The wyrms had come for Virtudom, as Fredel had sworn. When your days grow long and hot, when the sun in the North never sets, we shall come. A soldier ran into the sea to put out her burning clothes. For three days and nights, they had battled an onslaught from the Iron Mountains: housecarls, raiders, people of every trade and rank. All Hrthi were expected to be fighters, for theirs was a cruel land, a hard one. The creatures of the Dreadmount could be slain, but not with ease. Scale like tuff enclosed their bodies. Some had vulnerabilities  places where the flesh gaped, often at the shoulder of the wing  but some were so encrusted, it was hard to find a weak point for a spear or sword to pierce.

In the last one, Esbar had stabbed her in the heart, and she had woken in a sweat, convinced it was blood. She had not told Esbar. Across the hall, Esbar was taking her time at the rack. When she nodded to an Ersyri sword, the armourer removed its silver-mounted scabbard, wiped its blade with an oiled cloth, and handed it to her. As she held the sword aloft to inspect it, Tunuva recalled the cold twist of the knife in her dream. She shook herself. Are you ready, she called, or examining yourself in the ceiling? Why? Esbar sauntered to the middle of the hall. Do you suppose Id like what I see? Unquestionably. Many of their sisters had gathered to watch. Yeleni stood in a far corner, away from the others. She had seen out the long confinement imposed on her for abetting Siyu. You flatter me, lover, Esbar said, drawing her back to the matter at hand. She tilted the sword, resting the flat of its blade on her scarred forearm. But tread softly. They circled one another. Fill me with too much confidence, and I fear you may come to regret it. Confidence is a danger, true. Tunuva spun her spear. Arrogance, however, I can tip to my advantage. Lips leaning into a smile, Esbar lunged.",0,large

Epabo, Dumai said, thank you, for everything. I will lead the gods to avert his folly. She marched from the tent, into the freezing night, to collect what she would need. Dumai. Unora caught up to her, Nikeya just behind. You mustnt go. It could be a trap, a way of drawing you into the open I cant leave Suzu at his mercy, Dumai said firmly. Furtia and I will get her away. Taugran is much stronger than Furtia, Nikeya protested. You know this, Dumai. Not for long. I feel the coming of the star. It was true. Her awareness of it was taut and strong, a string pulled along the neck of a lute, tuned to something that moved closer by the hour. Nikeya, Unora said quietly, touching her shoulder, will you leave us a moment, and watch over Epabo? Of course. Nikeya dealt Dumai a concerned look and went back to the tent. Unora took Dumai by the cheek. Do not go to Muysima. I have to I wished, Dumai. When I was twenty. Her voice strained. I asked a wish of Pajati the White. Dumai stared at her. I wished for a way to reach the court, so I could save my father.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"I have sat here in the canyon for a week, to warn those who would come too close. I cant go back. I would sooner starve than He made the sign of the sword, his hand trembling. No soul should enter Halgalant that way. These people look to you for guidance, Saintsman, Regny sneered. And you cower down here? I am a sanctarian, not a warrior or a physician. Wulf drew up beside Regny. Sanctarian, he said, where is the former snowseer, the Issn? Locked into her home. So is anyone with sense. Regny tacked her gaze to the path. We must see the village for ourselves, she said, so I may describe this sickness to King Bardholt. If you insist, then I beg you, touch no one. It starts with a redness in the fingers. Sauma narrowed her eyes. And how does it end? The sanctarian shook his head and collapsed on to a rock, clutching his face. Regny rode past him without a backward glance. I dont like this, Sauma said, catching up to her. We should turn back. And what shall we tell the king? Regny said flatly. That we came here to understand the sickness and still have no sense of what it is? How will this help him, Sauma? Wulf knew the sharpness in her voice. She was nervous. Regny, he broke in, you are the Chieftain of Askrdal. Let us go. Regny stopped her horse.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"The sun has risen. Her voice was bereft of hope. The wyverns can see the moor clearly now. I dont think it will be long before our soldiers are dead. Even with the ones who came from Paupers Henge? Its not enough, Glorian. Theyre so tired. Tears streaked her cheeks. I feel just as I did when you fell off your horse. Youre in danger again, and I cant save you. I cant save Sabran. Its my fault. I should not have insisted on coming here. You did it for Inys. Adela brought fresh candles. Glorian slipped into a weary doze, Sabran gathered to her heart. She skimmed a strange and terrible dream, a sandpiper wetting her wings on the sea. She flew over a burning isle, and a need pounded her chest, hers and not hers: save her, save her. When she woke, she knew where she would go. Sabran grizzled at her breast. Glorian held her close, breathed in her sweet milky smell. You and I have something to do, Glorian told her. Then she looked at Florell. Ready a horse. A horse. Florell shook her head. Glorian, you just gave birth  what do you mean? I am Queen of Inys, Glorian reminded her, and I no longer require a regent. With my Saint-given authority, I charge you to bring me a horse, and a cloak. Queen Glorian. Bourn looked speechless, but managed to say, Your child needs her mother.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Glorian drew herself up. Mother retires after eventide. I will need to be at the spyhole by then. She grimaced. Lets not tell Jules. Shell only worry. They looked at one another. Or Adela, they agreed in unison. **** After the evening meal, she and Helisent changed and walked to the Royal Sanctuary. Sir Bramel and Dame Erda closed the doors behind them, leaving Glorian to her supposed reflection. Take this. Helisent took a fire pouch from under her cloak. Do you know how to use it? Of course. When Helisent canted an eyebrow, Glorian sighed. I am aware I lack certain practical skills as a royal, but do you truly think a princess of the North cant light a fire? I sometimes forget youve a claim to two thrones. Helisent presented her with a set of iron pincers. For the nails. They had worn cloaks of different colours, which they now traded. Helisent drew up her hood and knelt in prayer, while Glorian slipped through the sanctarians door. Helisent had discovered the secret when she was fifteen. Since she had a sharp eye for detail, her father had asked her to find some coroners rolls in the castle archives. During the search, she had come across an old plan of Drouthwick and noticed two windows she had never seen from the outside, adjacent to the room that was now the royal bedchamber. Combing the castle, she had found a dusty nook, bricked up at one end.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Every head on the ship turned. Bardholt placed a hand on the side. Archers, he called. Along with half the seafarers, Regny nocked an arrow. Steady. Sire, what comes? a voice said. Let us see. Bardholt narrowed his eyes. It has been a long time since I last heard drums. Not drums, Wulf thought at first, but Bardholt would know better. After all, he had been to war. It could be the Ments. Perhaps even the Vatten. The wedding might have been their chance to lure Bardholt to the sea, where they were strong. Perhaps they were tired of being his stewards, and even an Yscali princess could not temper their ambition. With those possibilities loud in his head, Wulf looked into the fog, one hand on his sax. What emerged from that fog was no enemy ship. It came not from the water, but the sky. A dark bird of prey, soaring on the wind. A sea hawk, Wulf thought distantly  except its wings were wider than the ship was long. They sheared the waves. In those first moments of seeing it, as his mind grasped for a touchstone and his senses slowed to a trickle, he recalled tapestries, sanctuary windows, prayer books, and the monster that haunted their borders. Its eyes were firepits, each slashed with a pupil as black as its scales. Eyes both empty and ferociously alive. The beast loomed above the Conviction, held aloft by those dread wings.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"By the light of the low-burning fires, they shared tales of their deeds, raising their cups to those who had ascended to Halgalant. Hunger was the unwelcome guest. Where food had once been rich, now there was only simple fare, even for the king and his guard. You all fought like the Saint himself today, Einlek said, when they had scraped every plate. None more than Gthur Wyrmkiller, whose harpoon felled the beast. For the first time, the guests raised their voices in a cheer. Gthur was pounded on the back. In the past, our people longed for a glorious death in battle, Einlek called. Now we can only hope to die well for the Saint, and for our best patron, the Knight of Courage, who smiles on us tonight. This may seem a small victory in a rumption, but remember what we did today. We slew a wyrm. The cheers rose. Wulf smiled at Thrit, who hitched up a weak one in return. I might replace this throne with that foul creatures head, Einlek said, to raucous laughter. Though hed kill me for saying it, I think my uncle would agree that a wyvern is a finer trophy than a whale. Finer, someone agreed, but not finer than Fredel! Cups banged on the tables. Aye, his head would make a dread throne. Einlek lifted his own cup. We will drink from that horned skull before I sit upon it. I will carve my uncles name into his bones.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"What makes you think I would have you, Lady Sabran? Her name was a dark thrum in his throat. How do you know I dont already have a consort in my own kingdom? Because I saw how you looked at me in the throne room. (He had not said no.) And how often. King Bardholt offered no reply. Sabran stood tall before him, for she was not her mother. I think, she said, that you are a man familiar with having what you want. This time, you need not seize it with blood and force. I offer it all to you. Be my consort. Your religion began with a love story. Am I the heathen in this tale, or the great slayer? Sabran only held his gaze. She imagined herself as a hook in water, still enough to lure a circling fish. I have heard the Berethnet queens bear only one child. Always, as far back as the songs go, he finally said. I will need an heir for Hrth, to consolidate the House of Hraustr. You have a sister. And she has a son, Sabran said. With Virtudom behind you, your new house will be unassailable. She lifted her chin. I know you will need to convince the snowseers to embrace the Saint. I know the Six Virtues are yet strange to you  but your realm is weeping, Battlebold. So is mine. Marry me, so all wounds may be knit.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Unora took a layer of cloth from the middle of the table, revealing the oily blue stone. Empress Mokwo wrote of a stone that could command the waters and the winds. Even the gods heeded its call, she said. It was said to resemble a moon, so the Grand Empress did expect it to be pale. Dumai watched her face. It had been a long time since she had seen her mother look nervous. The moon has been known to turn blue. Emperor Jorodu wore a strange expression of his own. Mokwo claimed a human could use this stone, but that only a chosen few could wake it  that for others, it would turn to dead rock. It will not answer to my touch or my wish, but I wonder if it will to yours, Dumai. Dumai reached out to set a single fingertip on its surface. A gentle thrum answered. I feel the power churning in it . . . but I dont know how to draw it, she said with a small frown, trying to articulate the feeling as it came. As if I had the hook and bait, and the water boils with life, but no fish come to me. She released the stone. Why not go to Furtia for counsel, Father? You must not. Unora spoke very softly. The woman who last possessed this is dead. For all we know, it could have killed her.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"With surprising care, she drew a thread of damp hair between her fingers, teasing out a pine needle. Are you certain you dont want me to comb this, Princess? Dumai could feel her own breath betraying her. A warm drift in her darkest waters. Daughter, have you lost your senses? I will manage, she said, starting to draw away. Wait. You said I couldnt style it for this court. Oh, yes  a messenger came at noon. Nikeya smiled. Queen Arkoro will see us tomorrow morning. Dumai stared at her in exasperation. Did you not think to tell me that earlier? I must have been distracted. Nikeya returned to the bath. Ill see you in the morning, Princess. **** In the guest quarters, Dumai lay on her bedding. As she tried to sleep, she remembered her strange dream  the figure who had spoken with her. On the mountain, the Grand Empress had started teaching her to control her dreams. The dreamer had to fall asleep, but also stay aware. Dumai turned on to her back, heels and hands planted on the floor. As sleep drew her in, she concentrated on those anchor points, trying to float instead of sinking deep under the waves. Are you there? There was the stream, winding like silver thread through cloth. Im here, the messenger answered. Dumai glimpsed movement in the dark. I suppose we cant say where we are. This realm is like a bubble, floating between the mortal and celestial worlds.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Dumai stared at the writing. Tonra speaks of a comet that will come in the twelfth year of the fifth century  next year  to cool the risen fire. This must be the answer. A comet. His expression changed. A comet is what keeps the balance in check. Father might know of it  but if this is true, this time of fire will not last for ever, just as Master Kiprun said. It is a wheel, always circling. It means we only need survive until this coming spring. Easier said than done. Kanifa coughed. Dumai, weve stayed too long. She stood without argument. Great one, we are ready to leave, she called, but Furtia did not reply. While Kanifa gathered the old papers into a sack, Dumai combed the cave once more, searching every crevice, trying to ignore how fast her heart was beating. She returned to Tonra, and noticed, on her second look, that the body was curled around something. A box. She thought it was of Lacustrine design, hammered silver with gilding, its surface beautifully engraved. Its shape put her in mind of fruit. With care, she took it and removed its lid  and there it was, the stone. Big as a plum and smooth as a pearl, it was darkest blue, with a white glimmer at its core. Dumai gazed into those depths, finding herself entranced. Kanifa. He crouched beside her. This must be what she was protecting, he rasped.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"And she understood what the dragon wanted. With a hundred thousand eyes on her, she reached out with trembling fingers. A living dragon, slippery as a fish, real and alive beneath her palm. There was kinship in that touch, and strength. Furtia nudged back with her snout. Come. She made a sound like distant thunder, and Dumai took another step. She closed her eyes, feeling a pull, a likeness, a want. The black scales were too slick to hold without slipping. Finding she was unafraid, she sank her hands into the waterfall of manehair. Her fingers closed in the heavy, oily mass, which smelled of steel and seaweed. Even though court had drained her strength, she still had enough to hold her own weight. She climbed until she could hook a leg across the dragon. She looked towards her father, and she saw the change in him, the hope. She had one brief, dizzying impression of the blue above, the stunned faces below, before the dragon surged into the sky. The wind howled, drowning out all sound. Dumai clung to Furtia, face already windburnt, and laughed as the sky welcomed her like an old friend. She had nothing to fear from it. Furtia Stormcaller rose towards the sun, and Noziken pa Dumai was flying, just as she had always dreamed. **** Evening painted over the last strokes of dusk. Furtia passed wisps of cloud, silvering them with the light that filled her crown.",0,large

I wished for a way to reach the court, so I could save my father. Sipwo dreamed of me that night. Unora spoke in little more than a whisper. Pajati is an elder dragon  born of the stars themselves, not the sea. His light was still within me when you were conceived. How do you know? He told me it would last one turn of the sun. She pressed one hand to her stomach, low down. I think it woke the old gifts of your line, in the waters of my womb. You could have been executed. It was forbidden. A blade would have been kinder than a death by thirst, or a wasting sickness.",0,large
A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon,"Dumai was frozen stiff. She could smell the beast, its wrongness, and the closer it came, the harder her heart pounded. Its eyes were fixed on her. Great one, stop! Her heels slipped as more briny water bubbled up beneath her. Furtia Stop, its too strong! Furtia opened her jaws in a roar. Then a wave of hot air struck her, and so did a terrible iron horn, scraping along her side. The white light in her crest hissed out. The sound that followed was like nothing Dumai had ever heard  the screech of the wind, threatening to rip her eardrums. Furtia seemed to collapse on herself, and then she was in freefall, silver blood spraying from her side like rain. The world reeled. Eyes streaming, teeth set, Dumai clung on. Furtia shuddered beneath her. Her crest flared back to life, and she whirled away from the approaching rooftops  but the upward pull was too hard and sudden, and Dumai lost her grip. In years of climbing on the middle peak, she had never fallen any farther than it took to gasp. Not with Kanifa to catch her. This time, she had no rope around her waist. She knew how to land: on her feet, knees loose, so she would break her legs and not her skull. There was no time for that. Something clipped her shoulder. A blinding flare of pain, and then she landed, in a downy snowdrift at the base of the clock tower.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I had to count the zeros several times before I could believe it. You did it, my mother said. She tried to smile, but we both wound up crying instead. As we celebrated, I wasnt thinking about how lonely I might feel, or how much I would miss my family. I couldnt comprehend what it would mean to attain that first foothold in a world they would be unable to follow me into. I didnt know that I would spend my early months on campus feeling as though Id wandered into another country, surrounded by students who never had to worry about buying books or finding somewhere to go when the dorms closed for a holiday. When I was informed that the terms of my scholarship required me to send regular letters to rich donors, Daddy-Long-Legs-style, and attend luncheons where scholarship recipients would meet and express gratitude to our benefactors face-to-face, I didnt blink. As an adoptee, I had long known what it was to be considered lucky, and to be expected to be thankful for it. Years later, when I described some of these rituals to a friend who also owed her education to need-based financial aid, she said dryly, Tell me that youre a poor first-generation college student without telling me that youre a poor first-generation college student. I laughed, but my instinct was to tell her that I hadnt been poorit wasnt a term I associated with my family, nor one my parents had ever used.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"The Priority Mail boxes begin arriving in June. Packed and shipped by my aunts, each box is stuffed with photos, documents, correspondence, religious items, knickknacks, jewelry. Sometimes I let them sit for days before I feel able to sift through the contents. Sometimes I tear them open at once, hoping to find items to show my family. One holds my mothers jewelry boxes, her high school diploma, her senior photo, and the stub of a ticket to a Simon & Garfunkel concert shed once told me about, her eyes shining: It was the best live concert Ive ever seen. In another, amid old family photographs I have never seen before, I find Moms wallet and drivers license, a bill from the attorney whod represented my parents in my adoption, and a copy of the will she had written only months before. Theres a wooden box full of bead necklaces: black and white, turquoise, yellow, royal blue, celadon green. Did she wear all of these? I wonder. Any of them? The only necklace I can recall seeing around her neck, at least in recent years, is her sterling-silver Orthodox cross with the dark blue inlay. My older daughter picks out a necklace of aubergine beads and gives it to her little sister. Rummaging through another box, I dont see what happens or how the string snaps; I only hear a sudden shower of beads hitting the floor. The girls pick them up together, sneaking slightly worried looks at me, but Im not upset.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"But had I been wrong to feel that way? They certainly never saw their burdens as mine to share, instead choosing to shield me from them for as long as they could. They were my parents: they looked after me, not the other way around. * * * The lack of air-conditioning in my childhood home was bearable because we could open our windows at nightexcept during wildfire season, when we might occasionally suffer and sweat in the hot, tightly sealed rooms of our house. The fires rarely threatened more densely populated areas, and I never worried about them reaching our house. From time to time, we would hear that a friend who lived much farther out from town had to evacuate, but I didnt know anyone who had lost their home to fire. I can remember only a few late summer or early fall days when smoky air settled in the hills and hollows around us, making it impossible to go outside and play. The land, the climate, and the housing patterns have all changed in the years since I left home. Four months after my mother died, a fire started fifteen minutes from her neighborhood. High winds carried the sparks far afield, allowing the blaze to grow and fan out for miles. Unlike the wildfires I remember from childhood, this one roared parallel to some of the busiest roads in the area, ravaging parkland, businesses, and thousands of homes.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When I lived here, I used to walk to another field near our old house to watch the sky darken above gold-limned hills. Sometimes, driving home in the evening, Id pull over to admire the viewthe riotous colors of sunset, the slow-deepening blue of the mountains as the light receded. Ive relaxed at peaceful eastern lakes and walked along Atlantic beaches, but have yet to find any substitute for these mountains. Theres a reason my mother still sends me cards featuring photographs and watercolors of snow-covered peaks and foothills clustered with evergreensshe knows how much I miss the geography of home. Every time I return, its the Cascades that greet me first, from the window of a small plane. Without words, without answers, they offer me the same peace they always have. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. I can feel my mind ease a fraction, though my anxieties are slower to dissipate than the strands of fog clinging to the base of the hills. Other than my family, theres little I miss, feel genuinely nostalgic for, in this sheltered valley. But the way I love these mountains, high and stark amid cloud cover and sun-shot sky, is as simple as the comfort of a dog, the promise of an Oregon rain shower. No matter my state of mind when I return, the friendly ranges encircle and welcome me, rising above green and gold fields, too vast to be outgrown; more than anything else, they make me feel that I might still have a place here.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"The medication hed been prescribed was expensive without insurance and also upset his stomach, so he stopped taking it, saying that he couldnt work and serve food all day while feeling nauseated. As restaurant manager, he was usually the last one who got to take a break or eat lunch, and when he did get a meal, the food most readily available were the pizzas he helped make. He had little free time for regular exercise, no extra money to give to a gym or a nutritionist, and unless he felt very ill, he did not go to the doctor. During the long years when he could trace no significant or debilitating issues to his condition, I doubt he had either the luxury or the inclination to worry much about his healthor his lack of health care. Even when both my parents found themselves unemployed in their late fifties, their initial worry was not for Dads missed checkups but whether they would be able to pay their bills, cover their rent, buy groceries and gas. That is, until my father grew very sick, the sickest he had ever been, and we had no way of figuring out what was wrong with him. * * * We had been living in North Carolina for five years and Dan was close to finishing his dissertation when I gave birth to our second child.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"If you really knew and didnt tell us, that was a real dick move, Dad. He did look peaceful, as if he had welcomed death, or at least been ready for it. When we approached to say our final goodbyes, Mom, mostly cried out by then, put her arm around my shoulders, her solid warmth a familiar comfort as always. Dont despair, she told me. This is our hope in the Resurrection. The words might have upset me coming from anyone else in that church, anyone else in the world. But I felt her sorrow as something deeper and more powerful than my own, a great river spilling its banks. I couldnt help but feel awed by her abiding faith in what she saw as my fathers victory over death. She was a warrior, even in grief. Though it was the middle of winter, she had asked that the traditional Paschal Troparion be sung at his grave. Everyone in attendance took a turn with the shovel, dropping earth over his casket with the Easter song of triumph resounding in our ears: Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life. I was no longer a regular Sunday Mass goer. There were too many things that I felt ambivalent about or disagreed with altogether, though when I did make it to church, I still found some reassurance in the rhythm of the liturgy, the prayers Id known since childhood, the echo of moments when Id felt a whisper of something like grace.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"Though Ive often wished that we could have come up with an argument that would have changed his mind, my mother believed nothing either of us could say would have swayed him. She said that he remembered his mothers agony after organ rejection, and in the end he believed that neither dialysis nor a transplant would give him a long life. The dialysis did its job, as it had for his mother, first saving and then extending his life. But the ongoing treatments left him drained and far more vulnerable to other illnesses and infections. His immune system was compromised; he was constantly getting sick. We knew that he wasnt thriving, nor was he improving. He was enduring. * * * He had been on dialysis for four and a half years when he began experiencing balance problems, head and neck pain, difficulty walking. After two painful falls and a high fever, he finally made an appointment with his doctor. An MRI showed an aggressive case of osteomyelitis, a bone infection, in his vertebrae, which was putting pressure on his neck and attacking his spinal cord. The doctor wasnt certain where it had come from; while the area around his dialysis port was vulnerable to infection, it appeared to be clear. His best guess was that the bacterial attack might have started in the teeth and gums, where my father was prone to abscesses and infections. Both diabetes and dialysis increased his risk of dental problems, and he had rarely had access to comprehensive dental coverage.",0,large

High winds carried the sparks far afield, allowing the blaze to grow and fan out for miles. Unlike the wildfires I remember from childhood, this one roared parallel to some of the busiest roads in the area, ravaging parkland, businesses, and thousands of homes. I was shocked to see news of the runaway destruction, although California wildfires had been in the news for weeks, and Id heard about the terrible air quality in the Bay Area, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver. My home region lacks a major urban center and rarely draws outside media attention. But the damage was too vast to be ignored, and terrifying headlines and images from my parents tiny town of a few thousand residents soon filled my social media feeds. I checked on friends and acquaintances and tried to call my aunt, who had inherited my parents house after my mother died. When I didnt get an answer, I texted Paula, who confirmed that she, her husband, and my aunt were safeand so was Buster. They were all hunkered down at Paulas, in sight of the flames but hoping they wouldnt need to evacuate. They couldnt say whether my parents home had survived.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I cry while I eat or drink. I cry in the shower, and when I lie down to try to sleep. Even when I am worn out, too hoarse for my sobs to make much of a sound, the tears keep coming, silently drifting down my cheeks. All I can think about is how, at the end, I wasnt with her. She was the kind of mother who deserved to have her child there when she died. Knowing that I had her steadfast support, that she loved and believed in me no matter what, made me so much braver than I would have been otherwise. It made risks feel smaller; it made it possible for me to trust myself a little more. Like any mother and child, wed had our conflicts, our weaknesses, our outright failures, but there had never been a serious or lasting rift between us. Her faith in me was a safety net I couldnt see until it was gone. I dont know what Im going to do without her. Without both of them. I never deserved them, I think. They were wrong to love me. But every time I try to hate myself, tell myself that I am a worthless daughter, I swear I can hear her voice in my head. It feels new. Dont say that, she says. Dont even think it. * * * Were nearly two months into the pandemic, but the funeral home representative tells me theyve never set up a live stream for a funeral and arent sure whether they can.",0,large

Thats why she believes that there is nothing for her to forgive now. I can choose to accept her at her word or not, keep chastising myself or not, but the truth is that this is what she has long believed: I am her daughter, so I am enough. When she is gone, I wonder, can I possibly learn to be enough for myself? What would it meanhow would it feelif I were? She has asked me what shes done with her life, how she can stand before God without fear. I think again of my father, whom shell soon be with, and how he might know what to say, how to reassure her, if he were here. But I am the person who is here now. My arms are the ones holding her, and I am the one who must try to give her an answer. Youre a loving, good, and generous person, I tell her. Youve tried to live the life you thought God wanted for you. Youve been the best mother to me. Im so lucky to be your daughter.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"All I would have focused on was that our expected family contribution was zero. Although many people identify as middle-of-the-road, middle-class, average Americans, there are differences between a working-class and a middle-class existence, and these differences can be far from subtle. If you grow up as I did and happen to be very fortunate, as I was, your family might sacrifice much so that you can go to college. Youll feel grateful for every subsequent opportunity you get, for the degrees and open doors and better-paying jobs (if you can find them), even as an unexpected, sometimes painful distance yawns between you and the place you came fromand many will expect you to express that gratitude, using your story or your accomplishments to attack those who werent so lucky. But in this country, unless you attain extraordinary wealth, you will likely be unable to help your loved ones in all the ways youd hoped. You will learn to live with the specific, hollow guilt of those who leave hardship behind, yet are unable to bring anyone else with them. * * * I spent my last few months before college working at the local Gap, a job to which I would occasionally return over holiday and summer breaks. As I had no retail experience, I did my best to project competence at my interview, emphasizing that I was a quick study (true) and a people person (less so). I suspect I got the position in part because the hiring manager saw my Asian facefinally an asset!

My grandmother, who looks so much like my father with her wide smile, broad nose, and brown hair so dark it could almost be black like mine, reaches toward me as Dad props me up on her hospital bed.

As grieved as he would be when his mother died a few months later, a part of him was relieved that she was finally beyond her pain. * * * When I try to picture my father as he was in my youth, healthy and strong, I see him working a busy lunch or dinner shift, wearing dark pants and a short-sleeved white dress shirt with a name tag pinned to it, chatting with customers. He managed a series of pizza restaurants for most of my childhood, and if I had no school and no one else was available to watch me, sometimes Id go with him for part of the day. I remember following him into dark industrial kitchens in the predawn chill, watching him check and order inventory. Every now and then I would try to be helpful, wiping down tables or refilling paper-napkin dispensers.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"My mothers oncologist recommended that she undergo chemotherapy just to be sure, but the prognosis, we were both assured, was excellent. Her treatments would be covered by Medicare, which she had just qualified for based on age, sparing her one worry, at leastthere was no mountain of medical debt waiting on the other side of this crisis. The doctors said that after this I should be cured, she told me. She sounded surprised. I understood why. After shed recovered from breast cancer, her doctors had steadfastly avoided using that word; they would say that she was in remission, or that there was no further evidence of disease. Many years passed before they would pronounce her cured. Three months later, she had another clean scan, and her oncologist said as much again: she was cured. Grateful though she was, she still wondered at the phrase. I didnt think they usually said that about cancer, she said. I sure hope theyre right. * * * She flew out to visit us in August, a few months after finishing chemo, toting two giant suitcases. One of them was stuffed with gifts for the kidswatercolors and markers, notebooks and pens, modeling clay and a package of multicolored sand. The three of them made enormous messes at the picnic table on the patio. I have a picture from one of those afternoons: my mom beaming in a peach-colored embroidered T-shirt, looking well despite having lost a dress size to chemo, her close-cropped hair growing back, happy to be bookended by her granddaughters.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I imagine one of them in the hospital, struggling to breathe, confused, terrified, alone. And that is always where my mind spins to a stop. As the days go by and virtual work and learning continue, our childrens discontent hardens into bored resignation. I start polling others about what I should do, partly because it is so hard to trust my own sanity and judgment. My questions are always the same, but a few patient friends pick up every single time to listen to me run through the terrible choices. Everyone is quick to say that they wouldnt blame me for going. But they also dont think I should travel across the country, not right now. If it were only you, and you didnt have kids, and you were close enough to get there on a short, direct flight, Id say go, my friend Nicole tells me one day. But you do have kids. A whole day of travel? All those cars and planes, all the people who arent wearing masks? We dont know enough about how this thing spreads, we dont have any good treatments that can knock it back, and now theres this multisystem inflammatory syndrome some kids are getting. Im standing under the dogwood tree in my backyard, where I often take phone calls nowoutside, so my kids wont hear me cry. Every tree and plant in sight is blooming, bursting with new life, and it feels like a mockery.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"When the kids and I call her another day, she is looking more like her old self, perhaps because shes wearing her glassesnearsighted as she is without them, Ive noticed she rarely has them on for our video callsand one of my fathers old Cleveland Browns T-shirts. I can tell that she is weak, and she has lost more weight, though she says that she still eats well. From the sound of her voice, she has recently woken from a nap. She holds up the flowers we sent her and thanks us, but even from the other side of a screen I can see that the online shop I ordered from has failed us. More than half the blooms are wilted. * * * May rolls around, and toward the end of one particularly long day, I text a friend: I think Mom forgot my birthday. Its understandable, I think. Its more and more difficult for her to talk on the phone or over Skype. Shes on pain meds that are only available to the dying, the kind of medication she refused when she first started hospice care, and she is sleeping more often. I wouldnt be surprised if she no longer keeps close track of the days. Im about to head upstairs to get ready for bed when my phone rings. Mom flashes on the screen. My breath catches. When I answer, she doesnt even say hello. We both know why she is calling.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"She sheepishly tells me that she used some of the money I gave her to buy new mini blinds. Thats perfect! I say. I dont care how she spends it, as long as its useful. Its hard for either of us to imagine her remarrying, or wanting to remarry. But as she begins to plan the next stage of her life without my father, I realize that I can picture her living out her own days in peaceand, more important, it seems that she can as well. My heart lifts when she tells me that she is planning a trip to Greece with two of her friends from church, intending to use whats left of my fathers life insurance payout to make her first-ever trip outside the country. All our calls are filled with talk of her plans: She and her friends are hoping to travel in the fall. They will visit monasteries and holy sites, see the sights, and swim in the sea; the trip is to be part pilgrimage, part escape. Her passport has long since expired, but shes started the renewal process. After that adventureonce shes readyI resolve to help her consider what she wants her new life to look like. At least I can be her sounding board, if nothing else. I know her ties to Oregon are strong after four decades theretheres her church, her chosen family, and I doubt she would consider leaving the area as long as my grandmother still lives therebut maybe someday shell decide that she wants to move closer to us.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"All I can think about is how, at the end, I wasnt with her. She was the kind of mother who deserved to have her child there when she died. Knowing that I had her steadfast support, that she loved and believed in me no matter what, made me so much braver than I would have been otherwise. It made risks feel smaller; it made it possible for me to trust myself a little more. Like any mother and child, wed had our conflicts, our weaknesses, our outright failures, but there had never been a serious or lasting rift between us. Her faith in me was a safety net I couldnt see until it was gone. I dont know what Im going to do without her. Without both of them. I never deserved them, I think. They were wrong to love me. But every time I try to hate myself, tell myself that I am a worthless daughter, I swear I can hear her voice in my head. It feels new. Dont say that, she says. Dont even think it. * * * Were nearly two months into the pandemic, but the funeral home representative tells me theyve never set up a live stream for a funeral and arent sure whether they can. Were looking into it. My mothers priest has privacy concerns about filming the service, and adds that it was already very difficult to choose who among my mothers many church friends could attend.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"We cant wait to see the life youll build together. They never saw me as choosing one kind of family over another, one dream or one life over another. They could not imagine a future in which I did not pursue everything I wanted. * * * We drove all over the region with my parents that week, taking advantage of the good weather and the timing of our trip; mountain roads that would have been impassable during the winter months were clear and open in early fall, and the occasional drizzle didnt deter us. Mom made us pose for pictures in front of a lighthouse, at the seaside botanical gardens she loved, on a bridge stretching over a rushing river gorge. My anxiety eased as the visit wore on, and it was a pleasant surprise to discover how much I enjoyed reacquainting myself with our little corner of the Northwest; time and distance had increased my appreciation, and I forgot to feel trapped or out of place when I saw my husband wide-eyed at the deep cerulean beauty of Crater Lake, the serene glory of a redwood grove, the wild cliffs overlooking the Pacific. I took pleasure in being the one to introduce him to these places I felt an uncomplicated love for, places that had been a familiar solace to me growing up. Sometimes, though, I noticed that my father would lag a bit behind or wait in the car while the rest of us tackled a trail.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"In her expression I read compassion, sadness, weariness. A deep well of concern. Her face was the first I ever glimpsed that looked anything like minefrom the moment of her birth, I knew that I was not alone. Now nearly twelve, she never resembles me more than when her steady brown eyes, my eyes, are like this, serious and appraising. She has always been her own person, frequently leaving me, the person who birthed her, wondering where she came from and who she will be. And yet I know she is who she is in part because I am her mother, just as I am who I am because of mine. Mama, she says, are you okay? I know she means in this moment, not all the ones to come. I reach for her, pull her into a hug, and give her the truth. Im not okay, I say. But someday I will be. I will be. Because of her, and her sister, and my husband, and everyone who loves me. Because my parents love me, and to live is to remember them. I will always miss my mother. In the months and years to come, Ill wish for many impossible things: that cancer had never invaded her body; that the world had not changed; that I could be with her when she died; that I could have split myself in two, defied the laws of the universe and linear time, to be present in every moment she and my father needed me.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"We would still belong to each other, but we would come to know one another differently in separation, in parting after parting. I didnt know what it would mean to leave, wouldnt begin to grasp it until my last night in my little blue childhood bedroom, a few months later, when I found I couldnt sleep for terror and wonder. I had spent most of my life in a small house in a small town, a Korean adoptee who knew I was loved but often felt as though I were living a life meant for someone else. Though dreams of escape had long held me in thrall, I missed my parents when I spent any considerable length of time away from them, and my mom was the person I most wanted to talk to at the end of the day. Im sure plenty of people who knew me were surprised that such a homebody only child had set her sights on a life three thousand miles away. It would be years before I would understand that she was the one, all along, who had been preparing me to go. Who wanted me to have the choice. I think of those late-afternoon talks with her now that I have my own children, knowing that the days of both of them falling asleep in their rooms down the hall from mine are dwindling; that a time will come when something trivial or life changing will happen to themthey will be hurt, or caught by surprise, or find that they are happier than they have ever beenand I will not be the first person they tell.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"You walked your path, you stayed faithful in your own way, and thats all I can ask. And who knows, she adds, maybe, after Im gone, well meet in prayer from time to time. Like the saints did. I hold her as tight as I dare, both of us now weeping. It is the first time in weeks, months, maybe years, that I have felt more like her child than a parent. This is your final battle, you know that. You should have gotten so much more time, I say. But if you cant have that, then I want you to be able to feel some peace, and have time to prepare, the way Dad did. I told the priest that Im afraid to die, she admits to me. Im so afraid to meet our Lord. I dont feel worthy. What have I ever really done? The answer couldnt be more obvious to me if it were written in the air before us, but I understand why she asks, because I know the feeling of unworthiness all too well. I have always felt as though I have something to prove: I have to do more, be better, to make other peoples gifts and offerings worthwhile; to earn their care or justify their faith. I spent years trying to live up to the noble sacrifice I believed my birth parents had made, while also trying to be good enough for other people to love.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"More than once, I thought of what my mother said when she got Buster: Hes good for me. He gets me out of the house. No matter how I feel or what I want, I have to take him for his walk. Im never alone anymore. In the last weeks of her life, Buster was always with her, curled up beside her in the hospital bed. My aunt takes care of him now, in the house he used to share with my mom, and I like to think that he remembers her as well as he canthe rooms may yet hold traces of her that a dogs sharp nose can sniff out. Im thankful that he was with her until the end. Now full grown at one year old, Peggy remains a puppycurious, affectionate, high-energy, ready to greet and be devoted to anyone who crosses her path. Her name is forever bouncing off the walls of our house: an excited greeting when we come home to find her waiting, tail wagging; a grumble of irritation when she does something naughty; a murmur of appreciation when she curls up next to us to offer comfort. She isnt allowed in my office, because I dont know that I could trust her exuberant bulk or wide-swinging tail around the breakables there, and suspect she might also try to nose some of my books down from the shelves. Now I write at the kitchen table, with Peggy napping at my feet.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I hear her voice speaking to me. And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reachits as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mothers sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my familynothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait Im sure I got from her.) I cant visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dads, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mothers memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one youre able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"It also feels as though Id be abandoning a household in shambles if I left. While Dan and I are both working from home now, as a scientist he is considered essential personnel and expects hell need to go back in eventually, and its not easy for either of us to get a full days work done with schools closed. It gets harder still when remote learning begins in earnest; our kids are grieving, isolated, irritable, and bored, and the last thing they want is to be assigned hours of busywork on a Chromebook. Our younger daughters Individualized Education Programall the supports and accommodations we spent years advocating for and hammering out at stressful meetings with her school teamhas essentially disappeared overnight. At school, she has a one-to-one aide; at home, she has us: Dan takes the math block, I take language arts, and we split the other subjects. If one of us didnt sit with her for every lesson, shed be unable to manage the multiple online platforms or access her schoolwork at all. There are always dozens of tabs open on my phone: flights home, a smaller number every day; articles about virus transmissibility; articles analyzing (guessing at) the risks of flying; tables showing infection rates where I live, and in the cities I might have to fly through, and in my mothers county. One morning, while struggling to pay attention to my daughters reading-group Zoom lesson, I think about how responsibly attempting a solo trip at this moment would mean two weeks of quarantine at either end, in addition to however long I spent with my mom.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"It all came too late to be of any use to my father. * * * I am still anxious when making a big purchase, whether it is necessary or not, and usually have to work myself up to justifying it. The car is fifteen years old, the air conditioner cant be repaired, its too small for all of us to be comfortable on long road trips  expenditure reluctantly approved. I tend to choose smaller, less important thingssneakers, nightstands, the number of streaming services we pay forto be stingy about, as if that will compensate for money Im forced to spend elsewhere. If I want to splurge on something, I will tell myself that I have to take on a freelance assignment or speaking engagement, earn additional income, to make up for it. And yet I feel an undeniable thrill when I buy nice things for myself or for others, because to me it will always seem like a luxury to spend money on something I want but dont strictly need. In contrast, my husbands approach to finances is rational, evenhanded, devoid of fear or strong emotion. Hes never had a meltdown over math. He can see the numbers in the columns for what they are: incoming funds, outgoing expenses, things we want, and things we need. He does not find himself worrying or becoming upset because our kids, like many, do not yet understand the advantages they have. Even when we discuss how much money we might need to be able to retire somedayor potentially provide for our disabled child after were deadhe doesnt panic.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"But the chest tightness was a symptom of anxietylike the tension headaches that came and went, the perpetual stiffness in my neck and shoulders, the faint twitch under my left eye, the unsettled stomach that sometimes made it hard to eat. I wasnt having the sort of breakdown Id once imagined, one announced in more obvious signs of distress: trembling, shortness of breath, a sudden elevated heart rate, dizziness or weakness or chills. Not until the pandemic hit and I suddenly felt like a rat trapped in a maze, frantically circling and unable to escape, did it occur to me that I might be experiencing a constant, low-level panic attack, a slow but inexorable spiral from which there would be no escape so long as my mother suffered and I could not get to her. And even then, I kept working, taking care of my children, doing what needed to be done. I cannot recall every symptom Ive ever experienced, every moment when I have felt the heave and pull of anxiety in my head or my chest or my stomach, but I suspect that I have probably always lived with it, this inheritance from both my families. I dont feel it in my body so often now; the physical symptoms crested while my mom was dying, and began to recede after. Sometimes I think that my anxiety is more easily triggered in the wake of my parents deaths. Or maybe it is only that I can now recognize it for what it is, no longer overlooking or dismissing it when it returns.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I was better at hiding my diary, but my mother always found it eventually. No matter how many hours my parents might have spent wondering and watching me write, Im willing to bet they didnt give much thought to the notion that I might one day publish a memoir. I never quoted Czesaw Miosz to themWhen a writer is born into a family, the family is finishedthough I was tempted to do so, once or twice, as a joke. Of course, I wasnt born into our family at alla fact that always mattered more to me than it did to them. They saw my adoption as Gods handiwork, and therefore above questioning. This was a perspective I understood, but eventually could no longer share. As I grew older, I came to see my adoption as the way I joined my family; the most obvious explanation, if not the only one, for our many differences; the source of questions I would need a lifetime to understand. When the simple story Id always known was no longer enough for me, when I began to reconsider what Id been told about my origins and search for a far more complicated, long-buried truth, my parents did their best to listen and to support me. And yet for all the conversations we had about what was lost and gained through adoptionfor all my certainty that it was never a single event in my past, but an ongoing, living story to be continually reckoned withI had not considered how my experiences as an adoptee would tint the edges of my grief when I began to lose them.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I checked on friends and acquaintances and tried to call my aunt, who had inherited my parents house after my mother died. When I didnt get an answer, I texted Paula, who confirmed that she, her husband, and my aunt were safeand so was Buster. They were all hunkered down at Paulas, in sight of the flames but hoping they wouldnt need to evacuate. They couldnt say whether my parents home had survived. Dan and I scoured the internet for local news reports, searching for the name of my parents park and other nearby landmarks. We watched shaky video footage shot by local residents; paused and zoomed in on aerial video shared by local news outlets, trying to identify my parents neighborhood. When I stumbled over an article about entire groves of ponderosa pines lost to wildfire, I felt another kind of grief. What if the cemetery had been leveled, too? I pictured the peaceful graveyard, with its hundred-year-old oaks and pines, bare and smoking; my parents gravestones scorched and illegible. I thought again of their house, their windows facing the mountains, their closets stuffed with clothing and linens and boxes of family photos, their shelves full of books and religious art and my grandmothers glassware and collectibleswas any of it left? When they sold the house Id grown up in, the thought of strangers owning itwhether they made it their own, updated and flipped it, or tore it down to build something newhadnt caused me a moments distress.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"It took me a while to find my way home. Everyone else was asleep when I crept in, and I was relieved that I wouldnt need to face them yet. I crawled into bed and slept for a few hours before waking to the sound of Dan, Cindy, and Rick helping the kids get breakfast. I got dressed, found the car keys, and snuck out the back door without a word to anyonewhich, I supposed, I could add to the growing list of things I would need to apologize for. I was too ashamed to tell my mother about my outburst, or that I had come to see her on my own this morning because I wanted her to do something for me; I couldnt have said what. She was my mom, and I felt sure that she was the one whod fix all of this, somehow. At the diner, we chose a table under a row of vivid abstract landscapes painted by the owner, as usual drawing a few curious glances from patrons who hadnt been expecting to see an older redheaded white woman with her Asian daughter. Mom got the Reuben shed told me she wanted, and I ordered a hearty farmers breakfast that made me think of the occasional weekends when my dad would bring me along to the diner where his football pool met. Id read the Sunday comics and savor my bacon and hash browns while the men, all dads I knew, dissected the weeks games, and afterward I would unstick myself from the Naugahyde bench and my father and I would go to a nearby park.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"No one, not even my mother, had ever said as much to me aloud, and it was somehow both affirming and mortifying to have my ambition and loneliness so clearly read by someone who barely knew me. I knew what I wanted, but I did not feel entitled to it. I was sure that I wasnt the most impressive student at my school. As glossy brochures began to fill our mailbox, sent from competitive universities located in distant towns and regions I knew nothing about, I asked my forbearing guidance counselor if he thought I was setting myself up for disappointment. Some of the colleges on your list might seem like a reach now, he said, but I do think youre right to consider them. Im sure that at least a few will want to consider you. Should I have been more worried about leaving my family? I was not privy to all the details of what they were facing, but I know there were signs I missed, or perhaps thought too little of, even as I scrambled to compensate. My mother was still recovering, emotionally and physically, from her surgeries. My father had his own medical issues and worked long, unpredictable hours at the restaurant. They were often unable to cook, so I learned how to make a few simple mealsmeat loaf and baked potatoes, beef stew and bean soup, eggs and waffles, Stroganoff made with cream-of-mushroom soup, pasta with marinara sauce from a jarand supplemented with fast food and TV dinners bought with money from my minimum-wage job, where I spent fifteen to twenty hours each week.",0,large

Dan, who would take much in stride that week, laughed and gave Sebastians ears a scratch, and my old cat immediately began to purr. * * * The day after meeting Dan, my parents had taken me to a furniture store near campus. Now a junior, I had recently moved out of the dorm and into a small apartment in a hundred-year-old building, and the only furniture I had was a twin bed and a cheap white laminate desk. As we walked through the aisles, looking at shelves and dressers, my mother said, I think Dan has decided that hes going to marry you. Stop, I told her. You always used to say that youd only marry someone smarter than you. Her voice had taken on the gleeful pitch it did whenever she was teasing me, or reminding me of what an absolute dork Id been. I couldnt remember saying that to her, but now it struck me as insufferable: What had I even meant by it? How had I imagined that I would judge such a thing? Why were we talking about marriage at all? Were smart in different ways, I said feebly, which made her laugh.",0,large
A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"I stay home with my family, and we continue to mourn in our own time, our own space, our own ways. Much as I want the pandemic to end, I find that Im almost thankful to avoid any semblance of a normal life. I suspect Im not the only person in mourning who finds even the possibility of normal to be an utterly foreign concept; who wonders how it will feel to face not just one place, but every place, without the person Ive lost. Perhaps this is the opposite of that searching phase of grief Ive heard about, when you imagine that you can somehow find and recover your loved one who diedI know that no matter where I go now, she wont be found. Here at home, the territory of loss does not change: I begin to understand how my grief fills this space; I know its height and its breadth. Every room holds memories of it. This is where I had my last conversation with my mother. This is where I got the call telling me that she was gone. This is where I livestreamed her funeral. This is where I lost her, but it is also the last place I had her, had a living parent at all.

A Living Remedy by Nicole Chung,"His temper could be unpredictable. He was not what Id call good in a crisis. At times, though, he surprised me. I remembered his serene pride at my wedding, the only one of four parents who didnt make me cry or lose sleep that week, and how much it helped to talk to him when I was homesick in my first semester of college. Tell me all about it, you know my hugs cure the blues. He was not my idea of a rock, but he was my mothers constant. Her life, for nearly forty-five years. She shouldnt have to fight for her survival without him. The bright colors in the paintings all around us blurred together. Blinking back tears, I did what I thought Dad would have if he were here: I tried to make her laugh. You know, its not like he would have been much help. I was rewarded with a faint chuckle. Thats probably true. God, hed be so upset. Hed be furious. Because this is bullshit, Mom, I said. I miss him terribly, and sometimes I still cant believe hes gone, she told me. A part of methe part that was his wife for forty yearsjust wants to be with him. I understood what she was saying. She had thought about halting her treatment. I knew that as long as there was any hope of gaining more time, she would seize it with both hands. In the months to come, she would fight with a fierceness that would surprise even me.",0,large
